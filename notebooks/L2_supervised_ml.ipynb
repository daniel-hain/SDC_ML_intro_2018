    "\n",
    "![](media/m8_cf1.jpg){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the `2x2` matrix with the foillowing cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positive:** (TP)\n",
    "     * Interpretation: You predicted positive and it's true.\n",
    "     * You predicted that a woman is pregnant and she actually is.\n",
    "* **True Negative:** (TN)\n",
    "     * Interpretation: You predicted negative and it's true.\n",
    "     * You predicted that a man is not pregnant and he actually is not.\n",
    "* **False Positive:** (FP) - (Type 1 Error)\n",
    "     * Interpretation: You predicted positive and it's false.\n",
    "     * You predicted that a man is pregnant but he actually is not.\n",
    "* **False Negative:** (FN) - (Type 2 Error)\n",
    "     * Interpretation: You predicted negative and it's false.\n",
    "     * You predicted that a woman is not pregnant but she actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just remember, We describe predicted values as **Positive** and **Negative** and actual values as **True** and **False**. Out of combinations of these values, we dan derive a set of different quality measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/m8_metrics2.png){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** (ACC)\n",
    "$$ {ACC} ={\\frac {\\mathrm {TP} +\\mathrm {TN} }{P+N}}={\\frac {\\mathrm {TP} +\\mathrm {TN} }{\\mathrm {TP} +\\mathrm {TN} +\\mathrm {FP} +\\mathrm {FN} }} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "** Sensitivity,** also called recall, hit rate, or true positive rate (TPR)\n",

    "So, which one should we use? Answer is: Depends on the problem. Are you more sensitive towards false negative or false positives? Do you have a balanced or unbalanced distribution of classes? Think about it for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROC and AUC\n",
    "An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve, weird name, i know. Comes originally from signal processing) is a derivative of the confusion matrix and predicted class-probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/m8_cf2.jpg){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does it tell us? The ROC is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds.  It plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/m8_roc1.png){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "**AUC** stands for \"Area under the ROC Curve.\" That is, AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1). It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. One way of interpreting AUC is as the probability that the model ranks a random positive example more highly than a random negative example. AUC ranges in value from 0 to 1. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0; one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC is desirable for the following two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AUC is scale-invariant. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values.\n",
    "2. AUC is classification-threshold-invariant. It measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both these reasons come with caveats, which may limit the usefulness of AUC in certain use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scale invariance is not always desirable. For example, sometimes we really do need well calibrated probability outputs, and AUC won't tell us about that.\n",
    "* Classification-threshold invariance is not always desirable. In cases where there are wide disparities in the cost of false negatives vs. false positives, it may be critical to minimize one type of classification error. For example, when doing email spam detection, you likely want to prioritize minimizing false positives (even if that results in a significant increase of false negatives). AUC isn't a useful metric for this type of optimization.\n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Finally, we fit another class of models which has gained popularity in the last decade, and proven to be a powerful and versatile prediction technique which performs well in almost every setting, a random forest. It is among the most popular non-neural-network ML algorithms, and by some considered to be a panacea of all data science problems. Some say: \"when you can't think of any algorithm (irrespective of situation), use random forest!\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a continuation of tree-based classification methods, random forests aim at reducing overfitting by introducing randomness via bootstrapping, boosting, and ensemble techniques. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model. The idea here is to create an \"ensemble of classification trees\"\", all grown out of a different bootstrap sample. Having grown a forest of trees, every tree performs a prediction, and the final model prediction is formed by a majority vote of all trees. This idea close to Monte Carlo simulation approaches, tapping in the power of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](media/m8_rf2.png){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application\n",
    "In this case, we draw from a number of tunable hyperparameters. First, we tune the number of randomly selected features which are available candidates for every split on a range $[1,k-1]$, where lower values introduce a higher level of randomness to every split. Our second hyperparameter is the minimal number of observations which have to fall in every split, where lower numbers increase the potential precision of splits, but also the risk of overfitting. Finally, we also use the general splitrule as an hyperparameter, where the choice is between i.) a traditional split according to a the optimization of the gini coefficient of the distribution of classes in every split, and ii.) according to the \"Extremely randomized trees\"\" (`ExtraTree`) procedure by Geurts (2016), where adittional randomness is introduced to the selection of splitpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We here use the `ranger` instead of the more popular `randomforest` package. For those who wonder: It basically does the same, only faster.\n",
