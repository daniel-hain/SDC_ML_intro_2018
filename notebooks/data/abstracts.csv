"Repatriate knowledge transfer: Antecedents and boundary conditions of a dyadic process","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049357378&doi=10.1016%2fj.jwb.2018.06.004&partnerID=40&md5=239918bc9cf64b5655eacd132664c143","In this study, we build on the ability-motivation-opportunity framework to test whether both repatriates’ disseminative capacity and domestic employees’ absorptive capacity as well as their opportunities for interaction affect repatriate knowledge transfer. Further, we examine the moderating effects of two distinctive factors associated with repatriate knowledge transfer: repatriate knowledge characteristics and characteristics of international assignments. Using multi-source time-lagged data from 101 dyads, we find support for most of our hypotheses. Our study contributes to theory and practice by providing an integrated analysis of antecedents and boundary conditions of repatriate knowledge transfer and by highlighting its dyadic nature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
"Institutional pressure and the implementation of corporate environment practices: examining the mediating role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047846353&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-12-2016-0531&partnerID=40&md5=4502140d5c8e3685b23679d10abf9306","Purpose: Contemporary frameworks on institutional theory and corporate environmentalism observe that institutional fields positively influence a firm’s environmental response in the form of implementation of environmental practices. These frameworks, however, provide little evidence on why firms facing similar institutional field differ in their environmental response. This paper aims to incorporate the intra-organizational dynamics within the traditional institutional theory framework to address this heterogeneity, examining specifically the role of absorptive capacity for environmental knowledge in the organizational implementation of corporate environmental practices. Design/methodology/approach: Integrating the institutional theory and resource-based view, this paper examines the mediating role of absorptive capacity in the relationship between institutional pressure for corporate environmentalism vis-a-vis the implementation of corporate environmental practices. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing based on data obtained from the Indian apparel and textile industry. Findings: The results support the mediating role of absorptive capacity in the relationship between institutional pressure and implementation of corporate environmental practices. Further, this study highlights the importance of acquisition and utilization of environmental knowledge in driving environmentalism through developing absorptive capacity; the findings also suggest that the role of institutional pressure in the implementation of environmental practices should not be analyzed in isolation but rather in conjunction with the development of absorptive capacity that forms the internal basis of implementation. Practical implications: Managers need to focus on the development of organizational capabilities for acquiring and exploiting environmental knowledge to complement their preparedness in responding to any institutional pressures for environmental sustainability. Firms also need to link their environmental orientation with various sources of environmental knowledge and capabilities residing outside the organizational boundaries. It is important to note here that the development of absorptive capacities for the exploration and exploitation of external knowledge is indeed both required and necessary to build sustainable organizational capabilities. Originality/value: This paper is among the very few studies that address the issue of knowledge and development of related organizational capabilities for corporate environmentalism. Recognizing that environmental knowledge resides outside organizational boundaries with regulatory agencies and special interest groups, this paper highlights the importance of developing organizational capabilities for the acquisition and exploitation of environmental knowledge. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Absorption, combination and desorption: knowledge-oriented boundary spanning capacities","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046902453&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-08-2017-0325&partnerID=40&md5=c9fe4ad4d6c27b24cc3f011611bfa92d","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to theoretically develop and empirically explore knowledge absorption, combination and desorption within and between organizations. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of knowledge-based view and absorptive capacity, the authors have conducted a multiple-case study to develop a theoretically grounded and empirically supported model of intra- and inter-firm knowledge cycles. Findings: Firms identify their knowledge gaps and stocks, both tacit and explicit, undertaking efforts to fill the latter and maximize the value of the former. The paper finds that knowledge exploration, integration and exploitation both within the firm and between firms relies on absorptive, combinative and desorptive capacities. Further, as such capacities are organizationally expensive to maintain, firms will often emphasize one capacity over the other and focus either internally or externally to meet organizational goals. Originality/value: While there is extensive research into absorptive capacity and some into combinative capacity, there is little empirical investigation of desorptive capacity and none into the integration of the three concepts; this paper seeks to fill that gap. Moreover, the resulting novel integrative model allows managers and researchers to identify the various capacities in use and their applications within the firm and between firms. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Performance implications of organizational ambidexterity versus specialization in exploitation or exploration: The role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048824803&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=f6a0e1eace3b9e9ce9ef5adf6ad9f708","Although ambidexterity is usually cited as a mean to achieve above average sustainable performance, theory indicates that due to trade-offs between exploitation and exploration at an organizational level, sometimes ambidexterity may be beyond reach, or ineffective, making specialization in exploitation or exploration, the more advisable course of action. However, there is no empirical research comparing the performance implications of ambidexterity and specialization in exploitation- or exploration-based types of innovations and the factors that may make each strategy more favorable. To fill this gap, we empirically test that absorptive capacity moderates the effects of ambidexterity and specialization in exploitation or exploration on firm performance. Using a sample of 281 manufacturing companies, results indicate that ambidexterity has a greater effect on performance at high levels of absorptive capacity, while specialization in exploitation or exploration is more effective at low levels of absorptive capacity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
"Managing technological distance in internal and external collaborations: absorptive capacity routines and social integration for innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010715534&doi=10.1007%2fs10961-017-9557-0&partnerID=40&md5=be10b10b26df3e760c18bf0752a634c5","While high technological distance to project partners outside of the established value chain can positively influence innovation performance, project goals can only be achieved if the social integration of project members is improved in terms of coordination and communication. This paper draws on embeddedness and absorptive capacity literature to explore how social integration mechanisms translate into different learning outcomes in distant collaborations within and across organizational boundaries. Drawing upon expert interviews with project members as our primary source of data, we conducted an in-depth multiple case study analysis of a number of inter-organizational projects. Our findings indicate that the effect of different types of social integration mechanisms on learning outcomes also affect the ability to bridge distances in process and product technology. Moreover, they suggest that it is not just the extent, but also the interplay of social integration mechanisms surrounding internal and external absorptive capacity routines that enable project members to engage in the exploration, transformation and exploitation of distant knowledge. In examining how social integration mechanisms foster learning outcome in distant collaborations, our study contributes to the literature on absorptive capacity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
"Managing sequential ambidexterity in the electronics industry: roles of temporal switching capability and contingent factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020702570&doi=10.1080%2f13662716.2017.1334538&partnerID=40&md5=ed6c022b17bde11ba4a3971065b2f907","Researchers on organisational ambidexterity have proposed several solutions to address the potential conflicts between exploration activities and exploitation activities. Unlike simultaneous ambidexterity, sequential ambidexterity–defined as temporal switching between exploration and exploitation–has not been examined fully, and the conditions under which this temporal switching can be successful are unclear. This paper proposes the concept of temporal switching capability to better understand the process by which sequential ambidexterity is executed. In addition, we hypothesise that performance effects are contingent upon firm-specific factors: a firm’s business strategy and absorptive capacity. Utilising three sources of data–a secondary database, annual reports and a survey administered to 145 firms in the electronics industry with 10-year observations–we find support for our hypotheses. The results show that the temporal switching capability positively relates to new product performance and that business strategy type and absorptive capacity have moderating effects. The results are meaningful in both theory and practice. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Commonality, conflict, and absorptive capacity: Clarifying middle manager roles in the pharmaceutical industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046724558&doi=10.1108%2fMD-11-2017-1086&partnerID=40&md5=bb85b325040cdb4bd56a64d004a40a5f","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the roles of middle managers (MM) in the knowledge-intensive environment as perceived by the employees, MM and principal decision makers (DM) in the context of the absorptive capacity process. Design/methodology/approach: In this qualitative study, the data were collected from pharmaceutical companies of Pakistan by using purposive sampling and the results were analyzed based on the thematic analysis approach. Findings: The results show that employees and principal DM have a strong agreement between them regarding the roles of MM; however, MM have contrasted views. Some of the roles were agreed to by all the respondents. Research limitations/implications: This study has focused on the roles of MM (common and conflicting) in knowledge-intensive pharmaceutical companies of Pakistan. The results of other studies on the roles of MM in the context of traditional and hybrid organizations may differ from this study. Practical implications: The results of this study show the importance of role specificity of MM for the smooth absorptive capacity process. While dealing with complex knowledge structures in pharmaceutical companies, this study gives strong input to HR mangers and consultants and practitioners as they continuously handle complex knowledge process activities. Originality/value: The study has explored the specific roles of MM by using the thematic analysis approach. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The impact of building information modelling (BIM) maturity and experience on contractor absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046019278&doi=10.1080%2f17452007.2018.1467828&partnerID=40&md5=233bf0753f3f8c0179bdaacec4da7433","Building information modelling (BIM) has been adopted with increasing frequency by the construction industry in the last few years due to its potential to enhance construction business performance. While there is a general belief that higher BIM proficiency will lead to higher business performance, few empirical studies have tested this relationship. This research explores the extent to which a positive relationship exists between BIM adoption and organisational learning. The impact of BIM maturity and years of experience on the absorptive capacity (AC) of contractors to adopt new information for organisational learning is investigated through a survey of Australian building contractors. While BIM experience was found to be a significant predictor for contractor AC, the analysis of variance showed no significant relationship between BIM maturity and AC. The literature indicates a pervasive belief in a potent relationship between BIM maturity and organisational learning, yet it seems that factors traditionally viewed as more peripheral play a bigger role than expected in determining the impact of BIM on learning and business performance. Subsequent interviews found that (1) poor business ties, (2) willingness to share information and (3) organisational cultural values weaken the expected relationship between BIM maturity and AC. The results suggest that the extent of an organisation's experience with BIM is a greater predictor of learning performance than the complexity of BIM usage within the organisation. The main contribution of this paper is to reveal the complexity surrounding the relationship between BIM and business performance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Broad Search, Deep Search, and the Absorptive Capacity Performance of Family and Nonfamily Firm R&D","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047383018&doi=10.1177%2f0894486518775187&partnerID=40&md5=06dc90d9dd5de14ea5dec49bacb9b96a","This study investigates how family and nonfamily firms learn. Specifically, it asks whether family influence fosters or hinders the transformation of the potential absorptive capacity augmented by research and development (R&D) into the realized absorptive capacity embodied by innovation outcomes. The conceptual model posits that family influence will enhance the absorptive capacity performance of R&D regarding exploitative innovations that tend to result from deep external search yet diminish the absorptive capacity performance of R&D regarding exploratory innovations that tend to result from broad external search. Regression analyses using a sample of 346 Dutch manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises largely support the hypothesized model. © The Author(s) 2018."

Building upon the knowledge-based view (KBV) and the organizational learning perspective, and using data from 376 high-tech Chinese firms, we examine the underlying mediating mechanisms and contextual conditions in the relationship between inter-organizational knowledge acquisition and firms' radical innovation. Our results demonstrate that inter-organizational knowledge acquisition has a significant positive impact on firms' radical innovation. We also find that realized absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between inter-organizational knowledge acquisition and firms' radical innovation. Moreover, we discover that knowledge ambiguity negatively moderates both the direct and indirect effects of inter-organizational knowledge acquisition on firms' radical innovation through realized absorptive capacity. Our findings contribute to open innovation research by discussing the mediating mechanisms of how inter-organizational knowledge acquisition can be converted to firm innovation via realized absorptive capacity. Our results also provide fine-grained insight into the contingent role of knowledge ambiguity, and how its interaction with inter-organizational knowledge acquisition and realized absorptive capacity can have profound effects on firms' innovativeness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
"Knowledge diversity and coordination: The effect of intrafirm inventor task networks on absorption speed","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051840388&doi=10.1002%2fsmj.2914&partnerID=40&md5=7eb6b4d2e4e5ffac75aca95ac0353219","Research Summary: We combine the absorptive capacity and social network theory approaches to predict how intrafirm “whole” network characteristics affect the firm's speed of absorption of external knowledge to produce inventions. We start from the widely accepted view that distant, externally-developed knowledge is difficult to absorb into the focal firm's own knowledge production. We suggest that high levels of intrafirm inventor task network diversity and task network density are essential for a diversity of knowledge inputs and coordinated actions regarding knowledge transfer, which in turn, reduces problems related to the absorption of knowledge—especially in the case of knowledge that is distant from the focal firm. The results of an event history study of 113 pharmaceutical firms that engaged in technology in-licensing from 1986 to 2003 provide general support for our hypotheses. Managerial Summary: Firms keen to keep up with an uncertain and ever-changing industry environment, can benefit from the speedy introduction of inventions. We examine how firms absorb licensed-in technologies to nurture the rapid development of own related inventions. We show that a firm's absorption speed depends on the characteristics of the internal collaboration networks among the firm's inventor employees. More specifically, technologically diverse and well-connected inventor networks improve the firm's ability to absorb external technologies quickly. This applies especially to externally acquired technologies that are unfamiliar to the firm. Depending on the distance of the acquired technology from the focal firm combined with speed-inducing inventor network characteristics, our estimates suggest that firms can reduce the time needed for absorption by several months.

"Investigating the Influence of characteristics of the new product introduction process on firm value: The case of the pharmaceutical industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052734062&doi=10.1509%2fjm.17.0276&partnerID=40&md5=c77a7da8c0f4c57e4a71e9dbb8c59d15","Scholars identify several benefits of new product introductions (NPI), yet prior literature largely overlooks how the process of NPI generates marketplace insights and influences subsequent products. Building on the concept of absorptive capacity, the authors argue that the influence of products on firm value depends on process characteristics, namely, the pace, irregularity, and scope of NPI. Using data collected from multiple sources for products introduced by pharmaceutical firms between 1991 and 2015 and robust econometric methods that account for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, this study reveals that pace and scope have an inverted U-shaped effect on firm value, whereas irregularity negatively influences firm value. Moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of NPI with firm value. This research documents the importance of adopting a portfolio approach to the sequential introduction of new products and incorporating insights gained from previous product introductions; it cautions managers against evaluating products in isolation. The authors discuss the economic significance of these results and provide actionable guidance for managers. © 2018 American Marketing Association."

Engaging in several activities (e.g., establishment of R&D centers, joint ventures, and staff deployment, etc.), Chinese enterprises ultimately aim for stimulating the interaction between the acquired target and the parent company. Challenging the conventional wisdom, knowledge transfer also happens reciprocally. The absorptive and disseminative capacities of both partners, along with the knowledge characteristics, and the intercultural issues, moderate the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited."

A benchmarking concept is developed to compare policies across countries, which takes account of country structural features, the way policies are embedded in the national STI policy context and the country’s development stage. We focus on policies aiming at fostering technology transfer and commercialisation of public research in selected OECD and emerging economies, drawing on the recent EC/OECD STI Outlook Policy database. Countries combine instruments across different policy domains, including business innovation, entrepreneurship and industrial policies in accordance with their public research orientation and business absorptive capacities. Policy interventions focus on upstream and/or downstream stages of knowledge transfer as attention is given to adjusting the supply of public research to social and economic needs or to encouraging business demand for public research results. Transfer and commercialisation of public research is increasingly integrated into STI policy governance. Policy sets for knowledge transfer tend to be denser in more advanced STI systems. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between absorptive capacity and performance in small family firms. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors theoretically argue and empirically validate that AC enables the creation of entrepreneurial, market and technology orientations in small family firms, which, in turn, lead to superior firm performance. They also tested the study’s hypotheses using mediation and multiple linear regression analyses on data collected from 272 small Indian family firms. Findings: The study’s findings suggest indirect relationship between AC and performance. The strategic orientations provide a mechanism through which investments in small family firms’ AC results in firm performance. Practical implications: This study offers crucial insights to practitioners and small firm managers regarding the use of knowledge-based capabilities in creating appropriate strategic postures, which, in turn, assist firm performance. Originality/value: This study is among few research attempts in understanding the knowledge aspects of small family firms. The present research contributes to the existing literature by unravelling the relationship between knowledge management and small family firm performance. Also, by bringing in data from an under-studied context of an emerging economy, this study strengthens the theoretical applicability of knowledge management in different contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Inter-organizational social capital as an antecedent of a firm’s knowledge identification capability and external knowledge acquisition","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042847944&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-04-2017-0131&partnerID=40&md5=51ac1a352680be0a7a78a3206659a5c0","Purpose: This paper concentrates on the antecedents of external knowledge acquisition of companies based on their inter-organizational relationships. Specifically, it considers social capital (i.e., the result of a firm’s inter-organizational relationships) as an essential precursor of knowledge identification capabilities and deliberated knowledge acquisition strategies. This study aims to propose that cognitive and relational dimensions of a firm’s inter-organizational social capital are mediating factors of the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capabilities and the relationship between structural social capital and the deliberated acquisition of external knowledge, respectively. The relationship between knowledge identification capability and external knowledge acquisition is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: This is a cross-sectional quantitative study with a sample of 87 firms from Spanish biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. From an extensive literature review, we developed three hypotheses that were tested using the partial least squares technique and structural equations model. Findings: The results only support a mediating effect of cognitive social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capability and a partial mediation effect of relational social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge acquisition. In addition, the findings show that firms with more advanced abilities to identify and assess the value of external knowledge will be likely to develop optimal deliberated strategies to acquire effectively such knowledge from its network partners. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are small sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study. The study also focuses on only two specific and innovative industries. Practical implications: Managers should understand that “good” management of inter-organizational social capital allows the firm to develop dynamic capabilities for the identification and acquisition of valuable knowledge. The results of the study show that managers should concentrate on building knowledge identification capabilities and should also be aware of the possibilities that social capital can provide to a firm to formulate and implement effective strategies for external knowledge acquisition. Originality/value: To date, there are relatively few studies focussing on knowledge identification capability and its relationships with the dimensions of a company’s social capital as enablers of external knowledge acquisition. For managers, the identification of valuable knowledge by using inter-organizational relationships and networks is an essential issue, especially in innovative industries characterized by continuous change. Theoretically, this research highlights that social capital contributes to the development of dynamic capabilities, allowing the firm to sense and seize business opportunities based on external knowledge acquisition to achieve competitive advantages. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The authors assess how perception of organizational commitment to learning and intrinsic motivation affects individual potential AC, and employee creativity and job performance as the key outcomes of individual AC. Furthermore, the authors examined the dual role of realized AC as a mediator in the potential AC-creativity relationship, and a moderator on the creativity-job performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws from 125 paired supervisor-employee survey data, where supervisors rated subordinates’ creativity and job performance. Hierarchical regression was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results confirm that both perception of organizational commitment to learning and intrinsic motivation contribute to the development of individual potential AC (above and beyond extrinsic motivation). Individual realized AC mediated the potential AC-creativity relationship. Employee creativity was positively related to job performance. Research limitations/implications: This study speaks directly to the question of how an organization can encourage its employees to absorb new knowledge, and the benefits of employee learning activities on their creativity and job performance. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to offer a more nuanced understanding of the development and consequences of individual AC – a level of analysis has been lack of empirical studies. It further point out how individual characteristic and perceptions can influence their learning capacity, and in turn, their performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, so far research has failed to establish this causal relationship conclusively. We extend research on project complexity by introducing the concept of team-level absorptive capacity and by studying its role as mediator between project complexity and project management success. Applying structural equation modelling to a sample of 285 respondents, we find an unequivocal, direct and positive statistical association between project complexity and delays and overspending. Further, we show that team-level absorptive capacity is critical for successful project management, but also that absorptive capacity can only partially offset the harmful impact of project complexity. Beyond adding to project management theory, the paper contributes to the wider management literature. We establish complexity as an antecedent of absorptive capacity and demonstrate how each dimension of absorptive capacity has unique determinants and outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA"

This research aims to explore the role of product and process innovation capabilities as two distinct mechanisms through which collaborative innovation networks improve new product performance. The study also examines the contingent effects of absorptive capacity on the relationship between collaborative innovation networks and the two innovation capability dimensions (i.e. product and process innovation). Survey data from 258 respondents from the Iranian high and medium technology manufacturing industries indicates the need for caution when developing collaborative innovation networks. We found that the effects of collaborative innovation networks on either product or process innovation capability are significant only in the presence of absorptive capacity. This finding suggests that the level of collaboration with different partners can enhance firms’ innovation capabilities only if the focal firm's managers have developed the capacity to scan and acquire external knowledge.

To tap into external knowledge sources, the firm follows a search strategy, which is known to be affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors. This study examines the influence of potential absorptive capacity on firms' external knowledge search strategy. We also propose and test a moderation effect of the appropriability regime on this relationship. Based on a panel dataset of 170 international firms from various industries, we find a curvilinear relationship between the level of a firm's potential absorptive capacity and the external knowledge search breadth. We also confirm the moderating role of the appropriability regime on this relationship.

In the current study, we used a matched set of responses from 294 frontline, customer-contact, hotel employees and their direct supervisors to address this lack. Consistent with extant human resource management (HRM) studies that have advocated the agent-centered perspective, this study’s results illuminate a causal chain through which employee self-reported (Time 1, Source 1) perceived high-investment human resource practices (HIHRP) augments individual frontline, customer-contact, hotel employee supervisor-rated (Time 2, Source 2) innovative behavior. This study contributes to the extant hospitality and HRM research literatures by elucidating individual hotel employee self-reported perceived HIHRP as a key proximal determinant and individual hotel employee supervisor-rated innovative behavior as a key proximal consequence of two positive organizationally relevant individual-level psychological outcomes: that is, frontline, customer-contact, hotel employee self-reported readiness for change and absorptive capacity.

The findings of a survey study of small to medium-sized Dutch manufacturing firms confirm that employee collaboration and search breadth have positive effects on an organization’s potential absorptive capacity, whereas employee collaboration also reinforces its realized absorptive capacity. Thus realized absorptive capacity ultimately enhances service innovation performance. The results have implications for dynamic capabilities theory, and they provide practitioners with potential means to outperform their competitors in service innovation efforts. © The Author(s) 2018."

Applying theoretical insights from a coercive isomorphism perspective, this article empirically tests both the moderating effect of supplier firm size and the direct effects of customer quality control requirements, supplier R&D absorptive capacity, and supplier-customer relationship quality on the supplier's propensity to benefit from customer knowledge spillovers. Analyzing a sample of 266 global suppliers in China with hierarchical regression technique, our findings demonstrate that, for smaller suppliers, customer quality control requirements significantly enhance innovation development while having no impact on larger suppliers’ innovation development. Our findings also show that supplier firm size moderates the effects of customer quality control requirements and supplier R&D absorptive capacity on supplier innovation development.

The results from dynamic panel model estimations reveal that local manufacturing firms benefit from the presence of foreign firms in upstream services, especially in the knowledge intensive services, and in downstream manufacturing sector. Demonstration effect is found to be negatively associated with domestic firms’ productivity, while worker mobility and increased competition appear to be the main channels of horizontal knowledge diffusion. The firms’ productivity is also influenced positively by human capital and intangible assets.

Therefore, we investigate TMT conflict (cognitive and affective) to understand how the firm-level knowledge capability of absorptive capacity (ACAP) is altered as a result of such types of conflict. Further, given that strategic orientations offer guiding principles for organisational behaviours, we suggest that the main effects of conflict are augmented by strategic orientations. Specifically, both entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation are posited to affect the relationship between conflict and ACAP, which expands understanding of the conditions in which TMT conflict affects ACAP. In all, a conceptual framework is developed to offer insight into how TMT conflict affects firm-level ACAP, highlighting differences that are dependent on whether team members collaborate via cognitive conflict or clash given affective conflict. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."

This trend might cause stiffer challenges on effort to sustain food security in the region. Design/methodology/approach: Five SEA countries were selected, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. R&D data were collected over the years 2001-2014. Collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation. Findings: Malaysia has been in the process of shifting from ANS to ECI cluster, whereas Vietnam and Indonesia followed the trend but about a decade behind; meanwhile, the Philippines and Thailand kept their focus on ANS clusters. Within the ANS cluster, Malaysia and Thailand leaned towards Modern Biosciences and Modelling (MBM) sub-clusters. The Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia were more focused on Agriculture and Conventional Biosciences (ACB) sub-cluster. ACB is more relevant and affordable to smallholder farmers. Shifting of R&D priority correlated with GDP per capita of SEA countries. Within ANS cluster, R&D activity in MBM increased but ACB decreased as GDP per capita increased. Research limitations/implications: Data used in this study were limited to accessible 2001-2014 data in five selected SEA economies. Therefore, there is an open possibility for future research on extended timeline using more sophisticated data analysis. Practical implications: Agricultural technology development should be relevant to needs of and affordable to smallholder farmers, as they are the primary food producers in developing economies. Social implications: If the R&D activities continue to drift away from farmer’s needs, there will be a possible drawback of widening gap between developed agricultural technologies and absorptive capacity of smallholder farmers. Government institutions should revisit their R&D priority as the current trend could cause a serious obstacle in maintaining food security in the SEA region. Originality/value: This frontier study provides an early warning for government in SEA economies and other developing countries for balancing between R&D for supporting smallholder farmers in food production and for enhancing national economic growth. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, firms experience significant obstacles in drawing external knowledge. This study aims to disentangle the role of IT-enabled absorptive capacity in new product development performance. The research model was tested with survey data of open innovation projects from 152 firms. Our findings indicate that IT-enabled absorptive capability improves open innovation project performance in terms of new product innovativeness and product speed to market, but we do not detect a significant direct influence of openness on performance. Our findings also show that the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and ideation openness significantly amplifies new product innovativeness while the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and implementation openness accelerates the product speed to market. This study theoretically contributes by building an IT-enabled absorptive capacity theory in the open innovation context and uncovering the effects of two dimensions of openness. In practice, it offers managers strategies to successfully conduct open innovation projects in deploying effective ITs and leveraging various types of openness during the two phases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The mainstream literature has considered absorptive capacity as a path dependent on the organization’s trajectory, which hampers its development in a relatively short time. However, there are studies that show that depending on the kind of knowledge sought, absorptive capacity can be developed in a more specific way. Confronted with this problem, this paper investigates the development of the absorptive capacity of a Brazilian university, facing the challenge of working on a university-industry (U-I) project in the semiconductor industry. The empirical research used the case study as a methodological strategy, through in-depth interviews, taking the UNISINOS - HT Micron project as the unit of analysis. Evidence suggests that the absorptive capacity was enhanced through actions that influenced the initial knowledge base, the training of human resources, the development of the organizational structure, and the establishment of inter-organizational relationships. The results also show that the formation of absorptive capacity is not necessarily path dependent, and it can be developed, at least in part, in the context of a specific project. © 2018 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

We take a two-pronged approach to address these problems: (1) conceptual distillation of the literature to discern the core AC dimensions, outcomes, and contingent external knowledge conditions and (2) meta-analysis of the empirical literature to synthesize the findings. For conceptual distillation, we identify three dimensions of AC: absorptive effort (i.e., the knowledge-building investments made by a firm), absorptive knowledge base (i.e., the current knowledge stock of a firm), and absorptive process (i.e., a firm’s internal procedures and practices related to knowledge diffusion). We develop these dimensions by explicating their theoretical roots, functions, mechanisms, and corresponding measures. Leveraging the conceptual distillation, we conduct meta-analyses of the empirical literature and synthesize key findings. We find that AC has a significant positive effect on firm outcomes and that the most commonly used dimension, absorptive effort, has the lowest mean effect size. We also find that knowledge acquisition and innovation generation fully mediate the effect of absorptive knowledge base but partially mediate the effects of absorptive effort and absorptive process on firm performance. Furthermore, AC’s effects on firm outcomes vary across external knowledge contingencies. Overall, this paper provides a strong theoretical and empirical basis to advance a dimensional approach in AC research and thereby facilitates a more rigorous research necessary for cumulative knowledge development on this important topic. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018."

Unlike previous empirical studies and given the coexistence of both benefits and potential costs to science-guided search, I conceptualize innovation as a recombinant search to hypothesize a non-monotonic relationship. Using patent data from the European Patent Office (EPO) relative to 3281 international firms over the 1999–2015 period, empirical tests yield evidence in support of the predictions. However, the effect varies with firm-level absorptive capacity, across industries and countries. As suggested by a limited attention model, I find a stronger payoff predictive power of science for firms with lower investor attention and higher valuation uncertainty. Besides, the association between science and future operating performance increases with time, indicating that firms’ scientific capabilities are a potent driver of long-term profitability. The conclusions are robust to controlling for the endogenous nature of firms’ use of scientific knowledge. By providing a useful basis upon which to judge the economic merit of firms’ innovation endeavors, this study contributes to reducing capital market imperfections that curtail access to external finance and ultimately spurring private-sector investment in R&D. It also provides evidence of diminishing marginal payoffs to science-led search. Finally, the evidence is likely to be relevant to policymakers, who might wish to influence the innovation ecosystem in a way to sustain long-term prosperity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

The model incorporates three essential characteristics of knowledge that have not been covered entirely by previous diffusion models: the network character of knowledge, compatibility of new knowledge with already existing knowledge, and the fact that transmission of knowledge requires some form of attention. We employ a network-of- networks approach, where agents are located within an innovation network and each agent itself contains another network composed of knowledge units (KUs). Since social learning is a path-dependent process, in our model, KUs are exchanged among agents and integrated into their respective knowledge networks depending on the received KUs’ compatibility with the currently focused ones. Thereby, we are also able to endogenize attributes such as absorptive capacity that have been treated as an exogenous parameter in some of the previous diffusion models. We use our model to simulate and analyze various scenarios, including cases for different degrees of knowledge diversity and cognitive distance among agents as well as knowledge exploitation vs. exploration strategies. Here, the model is able to distinguish between two levels of knowledge diversity: heterogeneity within and between agents. Additionally, our simulation results give fresh impetus to debates about the interplay of innovation network structure and knowledge diffusion. In summary, our article proposes a novel way of modeling knowledge diffusion, thereby contributing to an advancement of the economics of innovation and knowledge. © 2018 The Author(s)"
"Learning by Applying: The Case of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048535337&doi=10.1109%2fTEM.2018.2828000&partnerID=40&md5=7ef822434d38b4e676478fca79749d15","This paper examines whether organizations improve their quality performance after applying for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA). Using longitudinal data on organizations&#x2019; actual scores on MBNQA applications between 1990 and 2006, we examine whether quality performance improved after organizations&#x2019; initial application, the relationship between organizations&#x2019; initial quality performance and subsequent improvement, and whether quality improvement differed based on applicants&#x2019; industry sector. We examine these questions using the Heckman two-stage econometric modeling strategy. Building upon the organizational learning and absorptive capacity literatures, we find that organizations improve their quality performance after their first MBNQA application, initial quality performance displays an inverted U-shaped relationship with quality improvement such that organizations with low (but not the lowest) quality scores on their initial MBNQA application saw the largest subsequent quality gains, and organizations in the manufacturing sector experienced larger quality gains than organizations in other sectors. Analyses at the subcategory level reveal a pattern of findings that further corroborates our theory. We describe the implications of these findings with regard to operations management theory, managerial practice, and public policy. IEEE"
"The role of knowledge-intense high-impact firms in city innovation systems","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048542599&doi=10.1080%2f14479338.2018.1478734&partnerID=40&md5=9d6f43cdd6cf92d9ce43dd39f14523b4","Past studies on city innovation systems acknowledge the important role of firms, but rarely study them explicitly. This paper shifts attention to the firm level, and proposes that knowledge-intensive high-impact firms are especially important in shaping the economic development of local economies by creating industry-specific micro pathways. This argument follows from their central role in city innovation systems: we propose that knowledge-intense high-impact firms (KIHIFs) have a relatively high absorptive capacity and therefore make better use of knowledge spillover, but also play a role in distributing international knowledge spillover in return. To empirically investigate this thesis, we examine firms operating in the computer-programming activities, and engineering and technical consultancy industries in the capital area surrounding Helsinki, Finland. In line with our theoretical arguments, we find that the relative within-industry concentrations and rates of internationalisation of KIHIFs vary greatly over small geographic distances.

The study considers innovation variables with indicators linked to social conditions (social filter component) and geographical spillovers for 85 regions during the period 2010-2016. Design/methodology/approach: In particular, the study uses latitude and longitude coordinates to compute the distance between Russian regions according to the Haversine formula. In this manner, it measures the spillovers as the weighted sum of R&D capital stock on the basis of computed distance, according to the accessibility index procedure. Findings: The finding is very important in terms of policy implications for supporting employment. As the results stress that own innovation produces labour creation effects, while knowledge spillovers are labour-saving, the study could conclude that regional innovation policy may have undetermined the objective of an efficient level of absorptive capacity able to benefit positively from external innovation. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by exploring whether geographical spillovers are labour-friendly or labour-saving in Russia. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Drawing on theoretical frameworks of recombinant search and absorptive capacity, we assess how the distance of technological search, technological diversity, and brand focus (the ratio of own products to consigned products) mitigate the negative effects of contract manufacturing on incremental or radical innovation. Using patent data from 86 SMCs in the Yuci household appliance cluster of China over the period of 2006&#x2013;2011, the results indicate that distant search is positively associated with radical innovation when the ratio of related technological diversity to technological diversity (RTD ratio) is low, but not when RTD ratio is high. In addition, a stronger positive relationship exists between distant search and the incremental innovation in SMCs under strong branding focus and low RTD ratio compared with other configurations of branding focus and RTD ratio.

The hypotheses are tested empirically using a sample of 160 European technology firms. A positive relationship is found between the factors of the environment and stakeholder integration capability, and corporate entrepreneurship. The uncertainty and complexity of the environment in which the organization operates and its relationship with stakeholders require the firm to be involved in constant updating, collaboration between parties, and innovation of processes, products, and system to maintain competitive advantage. Further, the capacity to absorb new knowledge and develop technological skills can generate new, advanced technological processes. These processes foster corporate entrepreneurship to detect opportunities on the market and transform them into additional advantage over competitors.

However, small middle-income countries have played a marginal role as recipients of R&D-related FDI despite increasing policy efforts. In particular, several Latin American countries have recently launched new policy programs with the aim of attracting this kind of investments, but it remains uncertain whether public incentives can be useful to compensate for other locational disadvantages. The case of Chile provides an interesting empirical setting to explore these issues because during the last decade its government has been actively promoting R&D-related FDI through a new policy mix. This article suggests that for national innovation systems to benefit from the attraction of internationally-mobile R&D it is critical for public policies to ensure that appropriate linkages are established with local actors that hold absorptive capacities. Equally important for a small emerging economy like Chile is to prioritize R&D-related FDI in strategic technology niches where the country can realistically attain critical mass. © 2017"

We investigate two case companies, a medical device manufacturer and an aircraft manufacturer, and report on seven managerial practices for utilizing user knowledge. We adopt the absorptive capacity model in structuring our findings and elaborate three of the model's sub-capabilities (recognition of the value of user knowledge, acquisition of user knowledge, and assimilation/transformation of user knowledge) by proposing that each is associated with a distinct managerial goal and related practices: (1) Sensitizing the organization to the innovation potential of user knowledge, (2) identifying and gaining access to suitable user knowledge, and (3) analyzing and interpreting user knowledge and integrating it into product development.

We propose a game-theoretic model that analytically conceptualizes the interplay among the degree of same-side platform openness, the absorptive capacity of the entrant, and the intensity of network effects. Our analysis uncovers interesting new results. First, when entrant product quality is exogenous, under very strong network effects, the incumbent closes the technology. Moreover, we discuss various interesting open-platform co-opetition outcomes that arise under a fully covered market. When the entrant chooses the quality level and the incumbent is strategic in its platform opening decision, we find that intense network effects make new players shun the market, so intellectual property (IP) sharing is not possible in equilibrium. When the network effects are of intermediate intensity, the incumbent opens the technology to the entrants who have a sufficiently high absorptive capacity, calibrating the amount of sharing to the entrant's absorptive capacity level to ensure that the duopoly setting is mutually beneficial. Our key findings and insights are robust to several model extensions, including scenarios when the incumbent is uncertain of the entrant's absorptive capacity, or when the entrant incurs a general non-linear development cost structure. We also compare and contrast bounded versus unbounded market scenarios. We further explore the ability of the incumbent to engineer the strength of network effects in the market and uncover nontrivial alternating-monotonicity patterns for the optimal intensity of network effects with respect to the entrant's absorptive capacity. We also show that a model with exogenous network effects could drastically underestimate the range of entrants' absorptive capacity values for which the incumbent should open its platform, causing the latter to miss valuable co-opetition opportunities. We also discuss various managerial implications of our theoretical framework. © 2018 INFORMS."

In this paper, we employ a unique country/sector-level data set to investigate the impact of what is considered the ‘best’ type of foreign investment—greenfield knowledge intensive FDI—on domestic entry. Our results suggest that, in the short run, this type of FDI is positively related to the entry rate in the host country, if the domestic sector is either dynamic, or highly R&D intensive. These sectors may be respectively characterized by lower entry costs, which encourage a ‘trial-and-error’ learning business approach, and by a higher level of absorptive capacity which increases the chance of technology transfer. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Drawing from the empirical evidence of three Chinese firms’ outward M&A in three European countries, we argue the Chinese acquiring firms emphasized the transfer of explicit over tacit knowledge in the post-acquisition integration in their outward M&A.

The methods were regression analyses of training monitoring records as well as follow-up e-mail interviews with former participants of information and communication technology TPs sponsored by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. The research reveals that bilateral communication between training participants and the home organizations during the training plays a key role in increasing the probability of successful organization-level transfer of individual-level learning, irrespective of the original level of organization's absorptive capacity.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors therefore extend the existing literature focusing on the effects of cooperation and absorptive capacity on specific public financial support for innovation activities in Portuguese firms from local or regional government, central administration and the European Union by using available data from the Community Innovation Survey CIS 2010 and the application of logistic regression models. The empirical analysis enabled a better understanding of the positive relationship of the variables that determine the form of public financial support in the integration of incentives within firms to stimulate innovation. Findings: Therefore, as the level of absorptive capacity in Portuguese firms increases, so does the demand for benefits from public financial support to stimulate innovation from the European Union also increases. The same analysis, now considering the determinant cooperation, notes the positive effects of institutional sources of information and cooperation, in the propensity for seeking public financial incentives from the Central Administration and the European Union. As for internal information and cooperation sources, they are positively related to the integration of incentive measures from the local or Regional Administration and Central Administration.

Evolutionary competition in the model implies that innovation can overshoot the absorptive capacity of demand, leading to a slowdown in sectorial dynamism and even to structural collapse. Closed-form analytical results prove the existence of a unique stationary state in the dynamic model that is (globally) asymptotically stable. We show how the dynamic paths and the stationary rest-point depend on the trade-off between innovation and demand absorptive capacity parameters. To illustrate the plausibility and relevance of our results, we examine the Australian windsurfing industry in which diminished demand absorptive capacity (in the terms of the model) was a factor underlying sectoral collapse.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the technical efficiency effects arising from innovation inputs including internal R&D, human capital development (HCD), and foreign technology adoption in manufacturing firms in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional firm-level survey data from the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey and the linked 2013 Innovation Follow-up Survey. A heteroscedastic half-normal stochastic frontier is used for analysing the technical efficiency effects of innovation inputs of 418 firms.

We test our hypotheses using multi-sourced data on Chinese high-tech firms in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Our results show that ACAP and BS mediate the positive effect of EO on firm performance, and that as the development of market-supporting institutions improves, the mediating effect of ACAP becomes stronger while that of BS weakens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

We have reviewed 52 quantitative studies, released between 2000 and 2015 and codified 1,133 estimates. We run a regression of regressions which measures the strength of the FDI–productivity relationship. Taking advantage of large number of high-quality studies on FDI and its role in explaining the growth in firms’ productivity in Europe, we adopt recent meta-regression analysis methods—funnel asymmetry and precision estimate tests and precision-effect estimate with standard errors—to explain the heterogeneous impact of FDI. This paper assesses the country-specific impact of FDI on firms’ performance, after taking publication selection bias, econometric modelling and the individual studies’ characteristics fully into account. Our results show that on average FDI has a positive indirect impact on productivity. The impact is especially significant in selected European countries, and we interpret this as a sign of better absorptive capacities in those countries. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

These effects may occur sooner than the international effects, since they face no delay from partner negotiations and from financing and security concerns. For a key part of the overland Silk Road Economic Belt, we identify 46 prefectural-level units in a corridor from the China–Kazakh border to Xi'an that are likely to see increased investment and economic activity from Belt and Road. These units are smaller, more diverse, poorer, and less productive than are prefectural-level units in the rest of China. The Belt and Road Initiative will disperse some economic activity to places that the market would not direct it, such as to this corridor. Given that these areas are less productive and are likely to have lower absorptive capacity, investments here will have an efficiency cost since they should yield more GDP if deployed elsewhere in China. © 2018 The Authors.

At the empirical level, we examine effect sizes resulting from unidimensional, bidimensional, and multidimensional views of ACAP, and assess the impact of several methodological moderators on the links between ACAP and its outcomes. A total of 330 correlations from 96 studies show that ACAP is positively associated with organizational technological innovation and firm financial performance, and that these relationships are moderated by dimensionality, proxy choice, use of survey versus archival data, and cultural and industry context of the study. Recommendations for future theoretical and empirical studies of ACAP are included. IEEE"

In spite of widespread consensus on the role of absorptive capacity in innovation, the literature has so far concentrated only on traditional R&D and human capital based indicators of absorptive capacity. Furthermore, most firm-level studies investigating this relationship are cross-sectional in nature and there is need for longitudinal evidence. Employing the IAB Establishment Panel Survey on about 1200 private sector establishments in Germany during 2007–2011, we apply a structural model that links firms’ human resource practices, R&D collaboration strategies and finally their innovation outcome. Findings from the first stage of the empirical analysis suggest that adoption of employment practices positively affects horizontal, institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation, while compensation programs positively affect only horizontal R&D cooperation. In the second stage, the effect of cooperative R&D conditioned upon human resource practices on innovation performance is examined. Results indicate that firms having institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation relationships are more often associated with higher incremental product, process and new-to-market innovation, whereas the effect is relatively weaker in case of horizontal R&D cooperation. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature"

We make four main contributions to the existing literature. First, our characterisation of knowledge context provides the basis for a more specific identification of which elements of firms’ knowledge environment are important for innovation, discriminating between spatial, sectoral and network influences. Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms’ knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms’ interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms’ internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity. Our framework provides an integrating mechanism for existing empirical studies, and suggests a number of new research directions related to the determinants of innovation performance and the heterogeneity of innovation outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).

So far, we know little about the effects of these acquisitions on the acquirer’s innovation performance. Our paper focuses on two interrelated research questions. First, to what extent can Chinese firms increase their patent output following an acquisition? Second, which factors influence the post-acquisition patent output? Using a comprehensive dataset of 697 publicly listed Chinese firms in the manufacturing sector that conducted 1545 acquisitions from 2000 to 2012, we find no significant overall effect of acquisitions on patent output. However, we find that several acquisition-specific factors have a positive effect on the post-acquisition patent output (e.g., size of the acquired knowledge base, relatedness of the acquired knowledge base, cross-border acquisitions). Our study extends prior research on post-acquisition innovation performance to the context of Chinese acquirers. © 2018 The Author(s)"

A meta-analysis is timely to glean insights from the rich empirical evidence to date and guide future work on the topic. Our meta-analysis of 241 studies reveals that ACAP is a strong predictor of innovation and knowledge transfer, and that its effects on financial performance are fully mediated by these two outcomes. As different from most theoretical discourse, we also find that the firm size-ACAP relationship is positive for small firms but negative for larger firms and that the firm age-ACAP relationship is negative for mature firms and not significant for young firms. Our findings present a clearer picture of the performance implications of ACAP and also suggest the need to revisit traditional theoretical arguments on innovation, especially regarding the causal arguments underlying age and size. These results provoke scholars to revisit traditional assumptions of organizations and their patterns of innovation. Finally, we also take this opportunity to investigate factors that have been commonly considered to be relevant for the ACAP-innovation relationship, as we detail in our additional analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).

Geographical location provides a unique and different context and this paper aims to analyse the influence exerted by the territory on dynamic capabilities and, consequently, on business competitiveness. Using a sample of 610 high-technology companies drawn from the Technological Innovation Panel (2012), it is confirmed not only that firms located in scientific-technological parks are more innovative but also that dynamic capabilities play a mediating role in this relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

A second aim is to demonstrate how KIBS deal with this problem. A literature review provides the elements we need to identify the competitive issue that these organisations face. Then we try to explain how KIBS deal with this issue, drawing on two theoretical approaches: (i) Burt's social structural theory of competition; and (ii) the concepts developed in the knowledge management literature relating to intra-and inter-organisational knowledge processes.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the joint effect of open innovation and absorptive capacity on a firm's radical innovation. Open innovation is expressed in terms of external search breadth and depth strategies and absorptive capacity is described by distinguishing between potential and realized absorptive capacity. In order to test our hypotheses, we carried out empirical research in firms operating in high-technology industries. The results indicate that internal routines and processes for absorbing external knowledge help explain radical innovation as they show a significant effect of potential and realized absorptive capacity. Also, there is a moderating effect of absorptive capacity on open innovation. Specifically, potential absorptive capacity exerts a positive effect on the relationship between external search breadth and depth and radical innovation. Realized absorptive capacity moderates the influence of external search breadth. These findings confirm the complementary nature of absorptive capacity and open innovation search strategies on radical innovation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

We selected an instrumental case and collected individual semi-structured interviews, on-site nonparticipant observations, and documents to better understand the combination of absorptive capacity in organizational contexts. Findings revealed that the magnitude of organizational disruptions and time constraints influenced absorptive capacity metaroutines. The magnitude of organizational disruptions related to the intensity of required change for innovation adoption and the persistence of outcomes, while time constraints influenced the degree of involvement and cohesiveness of organizational members. In addition, findings showed that the combination of absorptive capacity metaroutines experienced asymmetries and had incremental and cumulative features. This work extends current theorizations of absorptive capacity conceptualized from a micro-foundation perspective as a collection of external and internal metaroutines and provides a means to start understanding potential factors that influence the combination of absorptive capacity metaroutines.

First introduced by Cohen and Levinthal (1989), it is typically defined as a set of organizational routines and processes that allow firms to assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge. An aspect that has been ignored by the literature on absorptive capacity is the nature of the knowledge being absorbed. This paper suggests that the learning strategies underpinning absorptive capacity adapt to the type of external knowledge they are more likely to get exposure to and as a result, not all the firms appear to benefit from the same type of external knowledge for the same level of absorptive capacity. To this purpose, we explore how firm-level absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between rent and pure R&D spillovers on the one hand and firm-level turnover on the other in three economic areas (Europe, Japan and US). The empirical analysis uses a dataset (sourced from the EU R&D investment scoreboards) made of 879 worldwide R&D-intensive manufacturing firms. Given the panel data structure of the sample, econometric techniques that deal with unobserved heterogeneity as well as weak exogeneity are employed. The empirical results suggest for the same level of absorptive capacity, firms in economic areas that are closer to the world technology frontier tend to benefit more from pure (knowledge) spillovers than from rent spillovers. Vice versa, firms located in areas that are not on the technology frontier appear to benefit mostly from rent spillovers that travel along the supply chain. These results suggest that absorptive capacity changes with the type of knowledge they may get exposed to. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

To test our hypotheses, we employ a multi-respondent research design based on a sample of 102 Chinese automotive companies.

First, the empirical results show that all types of external knowledge don't convey the same green innovative outputs. Second, they reveal that the success of the innovation process is strongly impacted by the access to knowledge sources but above all by the combination of internal and external knowledge in each phase of the green innovation process. The success of green innovations unveils the organizational absorptive capacity of external knowledge and their transformation into internal skills. Eventually, the risks associated with knowledge transfer can hinder the positive relationship between green innovation and the firms' performance.

Unfortunately the existing knowledge on each of these five areas is not being shared by researchers in the other areas, thus the models are focused on the particular research area. This study tests these constructs as a set of determinants of product innovation success. Design/methodology/approach: A field test using a mailed questionnaire to collect a relatively large sample of manufacturing companies has been used to test the proposed model. To eliminate possible multicollinearity among the independent variables, a multivariate regression analysis was used. Findings: The results provide clear evidence about the importance of competitive intelligence, strategic leadership, competitive intelligence, management of technology, specific characteristics of the company's innovation process, and company absorptive capacity with company success in new product development. Research limitation/implications: Despite the relatively broad scope of the proposed model, other factors may also be important and should be included in future studies. Practical implications: The items used for measuring the main constructs provide further and more specific insights into how managers should go about developing these areas within their organizations. Originality/value: While the study is grounded in the literature of what until now have been five separate areas of knowledge, it proposed a unique integrated model for these areas important to new product development. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Using multigroup structural equation modeling, this study partially supported that internal and external R&D are complementary in firms from high-technology industries, whereas they are not in firms from low-technology industries. For the two groups of firms, both internal and external R&D separately had a positive effect on innovation performance. These results suggested that if low-tech firms, which had lower absorptive capacity than high-tech firms, want to improve their innovation performance in the long term, they should start prioritizing internal R&D to improve their absorptive capacity while achieving a short-term satisfactory innovation outcome. As absorptive capacity rises, more complex strategies balancing internal and external R&D should be adopted. Contrary to expectations, the empirical analysis indicated that innovation performance did not influence short-term financial performance for the whole sample. However, in countries more affected by the 2008 crisis (for instance, Baltic countries, Portugal and Spain), this effect was detected, indicating that innovation helped firms to recover faster. © 2018, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Our goal was to discuss the relevance of traditional hypotheses on university-industry linkages to developing countries in light of evidence from Brazil’s Innovation Survey to provide empirical support on the basis of two groups of independent variables: internal characteristics of firms (size, intramural R&D, extramural R&D, product innovativeness, process innovativeness), and external characteristics of markets and policies (economic risk, innovation cost, government funding). We find that for sectors other than the most cooperation-intensive outliers, the main determinants of university-industry collaboration are size, extramural R&D, and product innovativeness. Extramural R&D appears as the dominant determinant and seems to occur at the expense of intramural R&D, suggesting a substitution effect. When the outliers are included in the mix, the main predictors are size, intramural R&D and government funding, providing support to the absorptive capacity argument. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

It further expands the discussion by looking at the relationship between geographic distance between partners and innovation as well as absorptive capacity, a variable that moderates it. The knowledge required for product development is classified into explicit and implicit knowledge, and based on such knowledge type, the form of learning and innovation is categorized into STI (Science, Technology and Innovation) and DUI (Doing, Using and Interacting). Accordingly, technology cooperation partners are divided into STI and DUI partners. The study analyzes the effect of the cooperation partner type on radical and incremental innovation. Unlike the hypothesis, cooperation with a STI partner had a positive effect on incremental innovation while a DUI partner had such effect on radical innovation. The geographical distance between partners had a negative effect on incremental innovation and the moderating effect of appropriability was not verified. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."

Extant literature identified knowledge differences and differences in goals resulting from different institutional cultures as important barriers to knowledge transfer. They result in ambiguity, problems with knowledge absorption and difficulties with the application of knowledge. Trust, communication, the use of intermediaries and experience are found as facilitators for knowledge transfer that help to resolve the identified barriers.

It’s well understood that an organizations’ culture is among the crucial factors for success and renewal of organizations. Yet culture is made by people and their attitudes. Innovation culture requires skills and competence by employees which are presumably beyond the traditional basic knowledge taught at undergraduate, graduate and post graduate level. This is even more evident for university graduates who’re mainly finding professional careers in the private sector who has special requirements to employees. Graduates’ skills are strongly influenced by curricula and the cultural values and norms outside curricula transferred by universities to students. But frequently these skills are designed by universities without profound knowledge of the actual skills required. At the same time organizations acting as potential graduates employers value researcher skills and competencies differently from how these are perceived. The paper suggests that understanding the professional and universal skills of researchers perceived and needed is one element of innovation culture. Thereby the skills in discussion go beyond purely academic skills only; instead it is proposed that skills which increase the absorptive capacity of companies are crucial for implementing effective productive innovation management. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature"

Our econometric model reveals that the inverted U-shaped relationships found by Laursen and Salter (2006) for external search breadth hold for all functional areas but those for external search depth hold only for R&D-based search aim ing at product innovation. In every case, we find that observed firms' breadth suboptimal. We also find suboptimality for search depth: The optimal depth level is the maximum for marketing-based and manufacturing-based searches. We also specifically show that marketing is the dominant base for external sourcing for product innovation, and manufacturing is the dominant base for external sourcing for process innovation. Finally, we find strong complementarities among the roles of the three functional areas, which suggests that firms develop different absorp tive capacities at the same time and do not substitute one for another. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Supplier Innovation Push: Timing Strategies and Best PracticesA number of motivating and moderating factors influence suppliers’ decisions to involve customers in the innovation process","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043598384&doi=10.1080%2f08956308.2018.1399025&partnerID=40&md5=266808bb54aaeebb3f85ff3855c81af0","OVERVIEW: Suppliers pushing innovations to their buyers face the challenge of determining when and how these innovations should be offered. This study examines which factors affect suppliers’ decisions about when to involve customers in their new product development process and offers best practices for suppliers pushing innovations to their customers. Using a qualitative case study approach, we find that suppliers’ timing strategies are affected by four motivating factors and two moderating variables. The quality of the relationship with the buying firm and the buying firm’s absorptive capacity determine the likelihood of a successful supplier innovation push. Suppliers can maximize results of innovation push efforts by avoiding buying firms’ purchasing departments, building personal networks within target firms, and raising the buying firm’s commitment to the innovation process.

While we acknowledge the role played by the adoption of a common corporate language, we argue that this response alone is insufficient to cope with the diverse foreign language demands that accompany global expansion. MNEs need what we conceptualize as language operative capacity (LOC): language resources that have been assembled and deployed in a context-relevant and timely manner throughout the MNE’s global network. Language resources are mainly derived from human and social capital, and their interaction, to form what is termed language capital. Managerial motivation and a preparedness to act are necessary to ensure that language capital is converted into LOC. Our theoretical explanation of LOC derivation is multilevel, incorporating two interacting processes: individuals develop, maintain, and contribute their own foreign language resources, but the MNE also plays a key role. It can influence individual behavior and, at the organizational level, provide its own language resources through the provision of computerized translation software and the like. The interaction between these two processes is seen to be critical in the formation and use of LOC. This multilevel explanation contributes to the growing body of literature that considers how human capital resources in general can be converted for productive purposes. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015."

The results are robust to alternative estimation techniques, measures employed to operationalize key concepts, and the industrial makeup of the sample.

To address this shortcoming, in this article we investigate the drivers of technological innovation in the solar photovoltaic industry. We find clear evidence for the existence of interfirm knowledge spillovers and show that besides investments in R&D, investments in manufacturing equipment have served as a channel of knowledge absorption. Our findings shed new light on the narrative linking environmental innovation and competitive advantage. Moreover, by pointing to the role of process technology as a means of assimilating and exploiting external knowledge, we highlight an important but frequently neglected channel of absorptive capacity. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications."

Extending previous research that has focused on the quantitative characteristics of knowledge, this research introduces a framework capturing the effects of both the quantity and quality of knowledge in overlapped and nonoverlapped parts of the knowledge base on subsequent innovation performance. Analyzing a data set of 192 technological M&As of 162 high-technology firms from 2001 to 2009, the results show that a high quality of overlapped knowledge has a positive effect on subsequent innovation performance, while the effect is negative for nonoverlapped knowledge quality. In addition, this research investigates the influence of the knowledge quantity on subsequent innovation performance. The implication of this research is that the knowledge overlap in technological M&As is essential for acquiring high-quality knowledge from the target firm and for improving innovation performance.

This is an important question because user contributions are important drivers of technological progress and business value. We examine the effect of platform sponsors’ investments in online communities on user knowledge contributions, using fine-grained longitudinal data from a leading enterprise software vendor’s community network. We focus on the sponsor practice of knowledge seeding, in which its employees provide free technical support by answering questions posted in discussion forums. We define user knowledge contribution as peer-evaluated, quality-weighted solutions that community members provide to help resolve the questions their peers raise. We show that the platform sponsor’s investments in knowledge seeding have a positive, significant association with user knowledge contribution. We also find temporal and geographical variations in returns on the sponsor’s knowledge investments. Specifically, returns (i.e., amount of user contribution that is stimulated) decrease with the age of the community, consistent with the observation that the most active contributors are lead users who tend to join the community early. In addition, returns vary across different countries, such that greater returns are realized when the investment is made in countries with higher levels of information technology (IT) infrastructure, partly because country-level IT infrastructure may be associated with greater absorptive capacity of these countries. We discuss the implications for research and practice."

However, the few studies focusing on the relationship between these two variables do not explicitly assess why transformational leaders facilitate knowledge acquisition, sharing and retention inside firms. This paper suggests that the reason is that the former contributes to the creation of an organisational context that favours learning processes. We test our research model on a sample of 467 Spanish industrial firms. Findings provide evidence that TL is positively related to the firm’s absorptive capacity and that this relationship is mediated by some organisational learning facilitators: experimentation, risk-taking, interacting with external environment and dialogue. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This study investigates how social integration mechanisms (SIMs; coordination, socialisation, and systems mechanisms) influence an incumbent steel company’s absorptive capacity (AC). A micro-level analysis of two radical ideas from unusual sources contributes to AC and radical innovation literatures by exploring relationships between SIMs and four AC capabilities (acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation). The findings suggest that AC capabilities are context-specific with respect to innovation novelty and idea source. The results emphasise the negative sides of socialisation and formalisation mechanisms, and the positive effects of coordination mechanisms on the AC capabilities in such high uncertainty contexts. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Most of the empirical literature has tested this hypothesis using a measure of local knowledge stock. This paper is aimed at extending the framework by showing that the domains over which local knowledge spans are also important. The paper investigates the impact of the configuration of local knowledge bases on new firm formation dynamics by combining the KSTE framework with the recombinant knowledge approach. Local knowledge bases emerge from the combination of different knowledge inputs. These inputs may be closely or loosely related to one another. Technological differentiation and the relatedness degree of local competences can be interpreted as characteristics of the local knowledge base interacting with the knowledge filter and the entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. The paper proposes a taxonomy of regional modes of knowledge production and investigates new firm formation in 92 Italian NUTS 3 regions observed over the 1995–2009 time span. The results confirm that the availability of local knowledge pools is important, and show that the ‘rich integration’ mode is the configuration that favours the entrepreneurial process.

However, existing research on the impact of customer involvement (CI) is inconclusive. Knowledge about customers’ needs and on how best to serve these needs (articulated in the service concept) is best obtained from customers themselves. However, codesign runs the risk of losing control of the service concept. This research argues that of the processes of external knowledge, acquisition (via CI), customer knowledge assimilation, and concept transformation form a capability that enables the firm to exploit customer knowledge in the form of a successful new service. Data from a survey of 126 new service projects show that the impact of CI on new service success is fully mediated by customer knowledge assimilation (the deep understanding of customers’ latent needs) and concept transformation (the modification of the service concept due to customer insights). However, its impact is more nuanced. CI exhibits an “∩”-shaped relationship with transformation, indicating there is a limit to the beneficial effect of CI. Its relationship with assimilation is “U” shaped, suggesting a problem with cognitive inertia where initial learnings are ignored. Customer knowledge assimilation directly impacts success, while concept transformation only helps success in the presence of resource slack. An evolving new service design is only beneficial if the firm has the flexibility to adapt to change. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

We use a pair-wise comparison of case research on German and Chinese firms, including two assembly groups (Volkswagen and SAIC) and two tier-1 suppliers (Bosch and Hasco). We find that the German firms adopt a closely integrated and in-house driven approach to vehicle development enabled by close, two-interaction with suppliers over a long cycle. The Chinese firms, by contrast, base their development largely on assembling externally available technologies drawn from around the world to create products that are improved through rapid design iterations drawing on market feedback. This is enabled by a different relationship with suppliers that involves providing innovation embodied in modular components and sub-assemblies to Chinese vehicle makers. Exploring the implications for existing theory we conclude that: (1) different supplier relationships play an important role in enabling competitors from advanced and emerging economies to adopt different innovation processes; and (2) these differences in nature of the innovation process need to be explicitly incorporated into models explaining the international configuration of R&D. The role of local R&D centres is not necessarily to internalize local knowledge. Instead, it may be to facilitate the integration of knowledge provided by local suppliers, necessitating the nature and role of absorptive capacity to be re-thought. Finally, we explore the implications for future competition in the global automobile industry, limitations and future research avenues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Such projects need to accomplish not only their TT objectives, but also get delivered within schedule and costs. Literature is replete with TT models, analysis of contractual arrangements, governing processes and influencing factors. Earlier studies have conceptualized TT outcome enablers and validated through practitioner surveys. However, studying sector-wide TT programs in their natural settings for developing economies has remained an unexplored area. This study adopted a seven step Grounded Theory methodology, applied inductive and deductive reasoning on open-coded granular case data to derive causal factors. These factors were then classified into facilitators and inhibitors and mapped onto TT outcome enablers. Findings from an independent survey of equipment manufacturers were used to finalize the set of causal factors for TT outcome enablers, which were then taken forward for structural equation modeling (SEM). Inferences drawn from successive SEMs, validated by findings from equipment manufacturer survey, distinguished the dominant TT outcome enabler. Further, it established two significant facilitators and one inhibitor. Insights drawn showed that absorptive capacities of ‘mid-range’ economies may have accelerated thereby beginning to differentiate them from other developing economies. The study findings can provide insights to policy makers and leaders for improving effectiveness of sector-wide TT programs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Innovation is viewed here as being either incremental or radical changes to the products (services) and processes (ways of delivering services) which are typical to the organisation (WaSCs). Product and process innovations may involve changes to some or all of technologies, organisational structure and processes, behaviour and culture, and knowledge and skills within the organisation and its supply chain. This paper sets out to provide an understanding of the factors which both enable and constrain the development and adoption of infrastructure investment process innovations in the context of water utilities concerned with water and sewerage service delivery. The paper documents the process and results from an inductive research programme of participatory action research undertaken within a large, privately owned UK WaSC to facilitate infrastructure investment process innovation. Employee narratives during the innovation process from initiation to adoption decision-making were characterised and analysed. The findings suggest that the development and adoption of asset investment process innovations tends to be skewed in favour of opportunities which align with (i) UK and European Union legislative and regulatory drivers; (ii) WaSC mission policy and goals; (iii) innovation cost advantages over a prescribed period of time; (iv) perceived risks to service provision associated with the introduction of the innovation, and; (v) the extent to which the organisational processes and cultures which act to increase the absorptive capacity of the WaSC to the proposed innovation are already functioning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Findings: To test the proposed hypotheses, the authors broke AC into its two sequential components – potential AC and realized AC, and tested their linkages with firm performance. The authors not only found the sequential components to be more reliable, but also found better explanation of firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings in this paper have crucial implications for researchers working in the domain of AC and knowledge management. By demonstrating the operationalization of AC as two sequential components, the authors make a case for more effective utilization of the construct in future studies.

In an individual-level study of 864 employees from a home appliance firm, we show that need absorptive capacity is theoretically and empirically distinct from solution absorptive capacity, and that both are positively associated with employee innovativeness. Interestingly, we find asymmetric extra-domain effects: prior solution knowledge is positively related to need absorptive capacity (cross-pollination effect), while prior need knowledge is negatively related to solution absorptive capacity (attenuation effect). We contrast the cognitive underpinnings of the two absorptive capacity types, contributing to emerging scholarly thinking on the domain-specificity and micro foundations of absorptive capacity. © 2018 The Authors."

The results suggest that benefiting from university cooperation is conditional upon the firm's level of absorptive capacity. At low levels of absorptive capacity, engaging with universities does not translate into any noticeable increase in innovative output. In contrast, medium to high levels of absorptive capacity is where a firm benefit most from collaborating with a university.

"Fostering integration through HRM practices: An empirical examination of absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer in cross-border M&As","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048066476&doi=10.1016%2fj.jwb.2018.05.005&partnerID=40&md5=5e718f22c6a5a02030a51fa184267aa6","Transfer of knowledge-based resources from acquirers to the acquired units has been ubiquitously emphasized as an important driver of post-acquisition integration. Equally emphasized is the importance of recipient unit's absorptive capacity for the success of knowledge transfer and the facilitating role of HRM practices in developing absorptive capacity. In this paper, we integrate different streams of research on post-acquisition integration, knowledge transfer, absorptive capacity and HRM practices. Different from most past research, we pay attention theoretically and empirically to the multi-dimensional nature of both knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity. We test our hypotheses on a sample of acquired Chinese subsidiaries of 181 multinational corporations from seven countries. We find that successful inflow and implementation of knowledge require the acquired unit to have distinct types of capabilities each of which can be developed by a specific HRM practice. These results contribute literature by recognizing absorptive capacity as a manageable capability and identifying how different components of this capability could be developed by specific HRM practices. Furthermore, our results shed light on human side of M&As by examining how companies can foster post-acquisition integration by fine-tuning the absorptive capacity of acquired units. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
"Absorptive capacity and ERP assimilation: the influence of company ownership","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046360637&doi=10.1108%2fBPMJ-11-2016-0228&partnerID=40&md5=7d4d1fc83e2559513023a2b2c227ab36","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt two different perspectives of an organization’s absorptive capacity, namely, the asset perspective and the capability perspective, to examine its impact on enterprise resource planning (ERP) assimilation. While prior IT knowledge represents the asset perspective, organization’s combinative capabilities – formalization, cross-functional interfaces and connectedness – represent the capability perspective of absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: The study develops a hypotheses-based theory of absorptive capacity. Data for hypotheses testing are collected from Indian organizations using a cross-sectional survey method. Partial least-squares technique is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results reaffirm earlier work showing the importance of connectedness and cross-functional interfaces in ERP assimilation; other two factors (prior IT knowledge and formalization) were not found to be positively related to ERP assimilation. To obtain more insights regarding the latter unexpected results, the study checked the interaction effect of the nature of company ownership (private or state-owned). The results pointed to the existence of a negative relationship between prior IT knowledge and ERP assimilation particularly in the case of private organizations compared to state-owned organizations. Originality/value: Previous studies on ERP have predominantly examined the influence of absorptive capacity on ERP implementation outcomes at the user level. The present study focuses on absorptive capacity at the organizational level using two perspectives. By utilizing two perspectives on absorptive capacity, namely, the asset perspective and the capabilities perspective, it illustrates how different aspects of absorptive capacity can be brought to light while studying its impacts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Absorptive capacity and relationship learning mechanisms as complementary drivers of green innovation performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043451963&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-07-2017-0310&partnerID=40&md5=d624b82cdfc965c040e1cb25a42c2def","Purpose: This paper aims to explore in depth how internal and external knowledge-based drivers actually affect the firms’ green innovation performance. Subsequently, this study analyzes the relationships between absorptive capacity (internal knowledge-based driver), relationship learning (external knowledge-based driver) and green innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study relies on a sample of 112 firms belonging to the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector (ACMS) and uses partial least squares path modeling to test the hypotheses proposed. Findings: The empirical results show that both absorptive capacity and relationship learning exert a significant positive effect on the dependent variable and that relationship learning moderates the link between absorptive capacity and green innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper presents some limitations with respect to the particular sector (i.e. the ACMS) and geographical context (Spain). For this reason, researchers must be thoughtful while generalizing these results to distinct scenarios. Practical implications: Managers should devote more time and resources to reinforce their absorptive capacity as an important strategic tool to generate new knowledge and hence foster green innovation performance in manufacturing industries. Social implications: The paper shows the importance of encouraging decision-makers to cultivate and rely on relationship learning mechanisms with their main stakeholders and to acquire the necessary information and knowledge that might be valuable in the maturity of green innovations. Originality/value: This study proposes that relationship learning plays a moderating role in the relationship between absorptive capacity and green innovation performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The purpose is aimed at completing the gap in the literature regarding determinants of EO linked with knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study was carried out on a sample of 292 Spanish firms in the agri-food industry. Partial least squares (SmartPLS software) was used to evaluate the measurement and structural models. Findings: CSC has a curvilinear influence (U-shaped) on EO. In addition, this relationship is accentuated with higher knowledge absorptive capacity. Practical implications: Managers should promote cognitively close networks and reinforce shared goals and culture with their contacts to maintain a high EO. Furthermore, managers should strengthen their knowledge absorptive capacity to boost innovativeness, risk taking and proactiveness derived from cognitive proximity with their contacts. Originality/value: This study adds value to social capital literature by pointing out a curvilinear relationship (U-shaped) between CSC and EO, in contrast to studies focussed on other dimensions of social capital, which have obtained divergent results. Furthermore, this study reinforces the key contingent role of knowledge absorptive capacity. The study provides a valuable theoretical framework of EO determinants connecting the cognitive perspective of social capital theory with a dynamic capability view. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Do firms located in science and technology parks enhance innovation performance? The effect of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050356173&doi=10.1007%2fs10961-018-9686-0&partnerID=40&md5=e1a6a5c457523e949d2b7e6fa342358d","This paper shows that the effect of location in science and technology parks is not homogeneous for all firms. The proposed model contemplates a non-linear relationship between belonging to a science and technology park and innovation performance, considering the firm’s absorptive capacity as a moderating variable. A panel dataset of firms located both in and off a park is created, and three main effects are identified. Pre-catching up firms have a low absorptive capacity, and their location in a science and technology park does not improve their innovation performance. Catching up firms have a medium absorptive capacity and constitute the group that can be observed to benefit more by their presence in a science and technology park. Additionally, pre-frontier sharing firms has a high absorptive capacity; however, knowledge duplicity reduces the impact of science and technology parks on their innovation performance. Findings arise practical implications for governments (how to assign public resources to parks?), managers of parks (how to select to the firms of a park?) and managers who need to decide about the convenience of locating their companies on a park (when my company is interested in locating in a park?). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"How ability, motivation and opportunity influence travel agents performance: the moderating role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044094127&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-07-2017-0308&partnerID=40&md5=3f1455259bd80236e73fb8f2bf9f5d46","Purpose: This study aims to examine the influence of the three dimensions of travel agents’ manager competencies – ability, motivation and opportunity seeking – on knowledge transfer and travel agents’ performance. In addition, the study investigates how employee’s absorptive capacity moderates the effects of managers’ competencies on knowledge received by the employees and moderates the effects of knowledge received by the employees on travel agents’ performance. Design/methodology/approach: A positivist research philosophy was adopted with a quantitative approach, in which quantitative data were gathered based on questionnaires to tackle different stages of the study. To test the hypotheses, a self-administrated face-to-face survey of about 42 questions, launched on November 7, 2016, was used to compile response from top and medium management Category A travel agents operating in Egypt. Findings: Based on a sample of 577 travel agents’ frontline employees, the results showed that the three dimensions of travel agents’ competencies have a positive effect on knowledge received by the employee. Findings further indicated that knowledge received by employee mediates the link between these three competencies and travel agents’ performance. The link between the competencies and knowledge received by the employee was found to be positively moderated by employee absorptive capacity. Moreover, these findings suggested that the relationship between knowledge received and travel agents’ performance is stronger when employees’ absorptive capacity is greater. Research limitations/implications: This study is bound by certain limitations that also provide fertile grounds for further research. First, the study examined how an employee’s absorptive capacity moderates the effects of managers’ competencies on knowledge received by the employees and moderates the effects of knowledge received by the employees on travel agents’ performance. However, innovation as a dependent variable can be investigated. Second, one limitation is that the study is restricted to Category A travel agents only in Greater Cairo. Third, examining the antecedents of ability, motivation and opportunity seeking to transfer knowledge is also important. Practical implications: It is important for travel agents, owners, managers and employees to acknowledge absorptive capacity as a critical component for organizations to sustain, grow and compete. Travel agents can also take steps to develop their employees’ absorptive capacity. Doing so would further enhance the success of knowledge, employees and travel agents’ performance. Also, travel agents’ top management has to ensure their employees’ absorbing knowledge, identifying and recognizing external knowledge, processing and understanding it, combining it with existing knowledge and applying the new knowledge to commercial ends. Hence, the development of absorptive capacity contributes to a travel agent’s achievement of competitive advantage. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by expanding the extant literature on knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity by investigating the influence of travel agents’ manager competencies – ability, motivation and opportunity seeking – for knowledge transfer in the Egyptian context. In addition, it investigates the direct effects of the three dimensions of travel agents’ manager competencies – ability, motivation and opportunity seeking – for knowledge transfer. Finally, the paper investigates how employee’s absorptive capacity moderates the effects of managers’ competencies on knowledge received by the employees and moderates the effects of knowledge received by the employees on travel agents’ performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Recently, research has suggested that organizations develop collaborative modes with Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) to acquire and combine Heterogeneous Sources of Knowledge (HSK) within their organizational environment. Innovation thus becomes increasingly generated by a cross-process involving a diverse set of industries. Nevertheless, few studies have assessed how knowledge from distant industries, such as CCIs, can affect firms’ innovation performance. Accordingly, this empirical research on a sample of 187 firms evaluates whether formal and informal collaboration modes with CCIs affect innovation performance. Moreover, it assesses the moderating role of both HSK and absorptive capacity. In particular, it aims to answer the following questions. What are the effects of collaboration modes with CCIs on firms’ innovation performance? What are the differences (in terms of effects) between Formal Collaboration Modes (FCMs) and Informal Collaboration Modes (ICMs) with CCIs on firms’ innovation performance? Do heterogeneity of knowledge sources and absorptive capacity increase the possibility of benefiting from FCMs and ICMs with CCIs in terms of innovation performance? The results contribute to the theory indicating that HSK are important to benefit from knowledge from CCIs, while absorptive capacity does not fulfil the same role. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: This study constructs and verifies a moderated mediating model of organizational forgetting to innovation performance, using the exploratory factor analysis and the hierarchical regression analysis based on a survey sample of 320 Chinese companies. Findings: The organizational forgetting is a critical determinant for improving innovation performance of an enterprise. A more detailed analysis reveals that first organizational forgetting cannot promote organization’s innovation performance without absorptive capacity. Second, the mediating effect of absorptive capacity is more positive when environmental turbulence is higher. Practical implications: This study provides empirical evidence about the importance of organizational forgetting in the firm innovation. Originality/value: This paper adds to the existing literature by providing a clear explanation of the impacts of organizational forgetting on innovation performance through a comprehensive empirical study. Contrasting with previous research, this research clarifies the boundary conditions under which organizational forgetting enhances innovation performance. In particular, the authors find that organizational forgetting is not equally positive but instead increases with the level of environmental turbulence. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Findings: SCA mediates the relationship between AC and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional survey and the use of managerial perceptions may need to use longitudinal and real measures in future studies to validate causal relationships. Practical implications: SCA may contribute to explain why AC improves firm performance. Firms with more agile supply chains may benefit more from their efforts in AC to improve firm performance.

For this purpose, a bibliometric review exercise is carried out in papers published between 2000 and 2015 in Scopus and WoS databases that consider ac as dynamic capabilities. Results of this exercise are compared with developments in the ongoing discussion over the topic. This research finds that most papers assume and apply the concept, and that the conceptual developments on the subject are scarce, especially when considering acap as dynamic capabilities. It is concluded that a priori assuming acap as dynamic establishes a restriction and, in many cases, an error.

Design/methodology/approach: The results of three studies (one field study and two experimental studies) are reported. The first study tests the interaction between EIS and the two dimensions of AC on group knowledge elaboration in a sample of 65 organizational groups. In the second study, EIS was directly manipulated and the interaction with AC in a sample of 65 groups was tested. In the last experimental study, the AC of the boundary spanner (highest level of expertise versus lowest level of expertise) was manipulated and the effects of EIS in a sample of 37 groups were tested. Findings: The first study reveals a significant interaction between EIS and prior knowledge base on knowledge elaboration and points toward a compensatory interplay of EIS and AC on GCC. The results of the second study indicate that EIS increases the time spent on task, as well as the efficiency of knowledge integration (GCC per unit of time). Furthermore, EIS has the strongest positive effect on GCC in groups in which at least one of the AC dimensions is average or high. The results of the last study show that the AC of the boundary spanner compensates for the lack of absorptive capacity of the group and also show that the cognitive distance between the boundary spanner and the rest of the group has a negative influence on the efficiency of knowledge integration in groups. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of Study 1, common to non-experimental research (related to causality), are dealt with in the second and third studies that establish causality between EIS and GCC. Practical implications: The paper has important implications for the management of information search effort in organizational groups, in particular the groups are advised to: engage in EIS to increase their cognitive repertoire and cognitive complexity, delegate, when possible, their most competent members to engage in boundary spanning activities as they will maximize the cognitive benefits of EIS and finally minimize the cognitive dissimilarity between the boundary spanner and the rest of the group to facilitate the effective integration of novel insights into the group cognition. Originality/value: This study is among the first empirical attempts to uncover the causal effect of EIS on knowledge elaboration and GCC in groups and to uncover the role of the boundary spanner in the EIS efforts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Although ACAP was globally introduced decades ago, researchers from Central and Eastern Europe have since underestimated its importance. The research objective of this paper is to answer the following questions: how does the level of ACAP influence the performances of technology-driven firms, and how does it catalyse their innovation outputs? Furthermore, we argue that exporting technology-driven firms possess even higher levels of ACAP than those who are weak or not-at-all exporters. ACAP measured value is examined alongside the innovation outputs of firms and their business performance, with an extended focus on exporters. A selected population of >600 Croatian firms were asked to fill in the questionnaire. Out of the 103 firms that completed the survey, 45 were recognized as intensive technology development performers, and 34 were identified as large exporters. Both populations were tested against formulated hypotheses, ultimately proving that higher levels of ACAP can be seen to positively drive innovation performance which, notably, can be seen most clearly with exporters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

The model looks at the mediating influence of marketing capabilities (innovative capability and new product development capability (NPDC)) and innovation performance (IP). Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a quantitative approach by using survey data from 333 Brazilian manufacturer managers involved with strategic marketing processes. Structural equation modeling was used to test the theoretical hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that ACAP does not have a direct impact on organizational performance. The relation is fully mediated by marketing capabilities (innovative capability and NPDC) and IP. Research limitations/implications: According to the research findings, managers should put efforts in the ACAP as well as marketing capabilities that will result in better organizational performance. This research is limited to the context of manufacturer firms in Brazil. However, it is suggested that an application of this research can be conducted in different industries and different countries. Originality/value: This study contributes to theory and management practice. First, no study has explored all these constructs together. Through the relationship between ACAP and performance, the authors found that marketing capabilities and IP can fully mediate the former proposed relation. The authors’ contribution is the understanding of the role of ACAP influence on performance.

This study also examines the moderating role of social processes on the relationships among these variables. Design/methodology/approach: To test the proposed model, cross-sectional data were collected regarding projects from 133 PBOs in Pakistan’s information technology/software industry. The data were analyzed using the partial least squares – structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method and PRCOESS tool. Finally, this study also uses causal asymmetry analysis to check asymmetric relationship in the key constructs. Findings: The results generally support the proposed model. Knowledge governance and knowledge sharing are important antecedents for improving the ACAP of the project, which in turn significantly improves project performance. Additionally, social processes positively moderate the relationship between knowledge sharing and ACAP, as well as between ACAP and project performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that PBOs should invest in developing a knowledge governance system that guides and stimulates knowledge sharing within and between projects. This would boost the ACAP of projects and lead to superior project performance. Originality/value: This study addresses the important issue of knowledge management in IT/software projects. It proposes a unique model that integrates the key constructs of knowledge management and describes their effect on project performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Following a process research approach and based on in-depth comparative case studies of four German manufacturing companies, we develop and empirically validate a procss model of the firm-internal AC process. Our model integrates the different single elements (e.g., individuals, teams, departments) as well as the different linear and nonlinear causal interactions that constitute the firm's ability to identify, adopt, implement and exploit external information and knowledge. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on various organizational leverages to increase the effectiveness of the identified process flows. The findings provide explanatory insight into the organisational prerequisites of AC. Thus, the paper simultaneously contributes to enhance the academic and management's understanding of firms' AC by identifying its constitutional key elements, their different kinds of processual interrelation as well as organisational prerequisites and points of leverage to modify, measure, and improve the AC of a company. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined the role of innovation and MC capability on the relationship between AC and BP. Data from 278 Chinese firms in four manufacturing industries collected by questionnaire are used to empirically examine the proposed model by Structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that AC can directly enhance BP, and indirectly through innovation and MC capability. The study also finds that MC capability has a stronger mediating effect than innovation. Originality/value: Prior studies have not yet built linkages between AC and BP with both innovation and MC’s effects. This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of AC on BP and three paths are discussed including AC’s direct effect and indirect effects through innovation and MC to firm’s BP. This study provides a new direction for executives to better understand the movement of knowledge along supply chain and in intra-organizational environment, and of the importance of innovation and MC capability since they are essential carriers for BP enhancement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Effects of absorptive capacity, trust and information systems on product innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040867588&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-11-2015-0687&partnerID=40&md5=ca864ea9ffde93002cae1ff3b3242dbd","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity (AC), trust and information systems jointly influence product innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a research model to examine the mediating role of AC on the impacts of trust and information systems on product innovation and the moderating roles of trust and information systems on the relationship between AC and product innovation. The hypotheses are empirically tested using regression and bootstrapping methods and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. Findings: This study finds that trust and information systems positively affect product innovation and the effects are fully mediated by AC. AC also significantly enhances product innovation, and the effect is amplified by trust as well as information systems. In addition, the results show that trust and information systems improve AC both individually and interactively. Originality/value: The findings extend existing knowledge on the antecedents of AC and the contingent conditions under which a manufacturer’s AC is more effective than that of its rivals. The results also clarify the mechanisms through which trust and information systems improve product innovation. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among a manufacturer’s sociotechnical systems, knowledge management processes and new product development, and reveals how to design organisational systems to fully capitalise the value of AC on product innovation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The research also aims to determine whether ACAP has a mediating role in the relation between EO and TIC. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation model was designed to examine the relationships. On the basis of a research framework, a self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data from SMEs owners in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. There were 432 out of 676 questionnaires returned and subsequently used for statistical analysis. Findings: The outcomes of the present research indicate both EO and ACAP have significant effects on TIC. Furthermore, the outcomes suggest that ACAP has a mediation role in the nexus between EO and TIC and that indicates the ability of EO to strengthen TIC via ACAP. Originality/value: The research contributes to the literature through three aspects. First, it provides some empirical evidence on the relationships between EO, ACAP and TIC of SMEs. Second, the research sheds light on the insights that firms can use externally generated knowledge as a mechanism to enhance their proactivity and willingness toward innovation. Third, for the innovation literature, it is valuable contribution to placing ACAP within the frame of EO. Thus, they can be advantageous to more development in innovation literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: Hypothesised relationships are tested with survey data from 302 Spanish manufacturing firms using structural equations modelling. Findings: Environmental dynamism is positively associated with both OAC and OL, and both dynamic capabilities enable SCF. The authors also find that the relationship between environmental dynamism and SCF is partially mediated by both dynamic capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature, for example, by determining when it is advantageous to develop SCF, by specifying what capabilities a firm needs to develop to align SCF with the environment, and by opening the black box that is the relationship between the environment and SCF. Practical implications: Managers should develop SCF via OAC and OL when they detect a high degree of environmental dynamism. Knowing when this is necessary relies on a good understanding of the environment. OAC is found to be a stronger enabler of SCF than OL. The findings provide managers with an insight into why some firms are able to develop more effective responses to dynamic environments than others. Originality/value: This study is one of only a limited number of studies that adopt a dynamic capabilities approach to supply chain management. Prior literature has shown that dynamic capabilities can aid in developing strategic, structural, and operational flexibility. The authors extend this literature by showing that OAC and OL have an effect on SCF. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this qualitative case study of a microentreprise, we follow Mol and Birkinshaw (2014) who claimed for research on MI generation, highlighting “how relations with external and internal partners can deliver knowledge” (2009). We focus on the entrepreneur-CPA relationship to study how the relationship between the CPA as an external change actor and the entrepreneur as an internal change actor can be a lever of MI generation in microentreprises. More particularly, we aim at understanding how the external CPA knowledge can be internalised by the entrepreneur in microentreprises through the acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation of knowledge. And more particularly, we propose to highlight the key drivers of the generation of MI in microentreprises through the study of the process by which a potential ACAP becomes realised (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Lane et al., 2006; Gebauer et al., 2012; Marabelli and Newell, 2014).

This paper probes the role of absorptive capacity in furthering the cluster linkages and thereby enhancing the innovation performance of a firm. Design/methodology/approach – This study adopts stratified random sampling technique to choose sample firms from the identified population of firms in a cluster. Further, it employs primary data collection method to collect data from sample firms through a semi-structured questionnaire based in-depth interviews with the top level management of sample firms. It uses multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques to ascertain the influence of absorptive capacity on degree of cluster linkages (both intra-cluster and extra-cluster linkages), and degree of cluster linkages (both intra-cluster and extra-cluster linkages) on innovation performance of a firm. Findings – On the one hand, internal factors of absorptive capacity of a firm have a significant positive influence on the degrees of both intra-cluster linkages and extra-cluster linkages. On the other hand, external factors of absorptive capacity of a firm significantly impact the degree of intra-cluster linkages (DICL). But, they have no significant influence on the degree of extra-cluster linkages (DECL). Further, both the DICL and the DECL drive innovation performance of a firm in a cluster. Notably, subsidiaries of externally based firms exhibit superior innovation performance compared to those firms based in a cluster. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the extant literature in two ways. First, it empirically validates the effect of absorptive capacity of a firm on its degree of cluster linkages (both intra-cluster and extra-cluster linkages) taking into account both internal and external factors of absorptive capacity. Second, it ascertains the influence of degree of cluster linkages (both intra-cluster and extra-cluster linkages) on the innovation performance of a firm in a cluster. © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Impact of knowledge sharing, learning adaptability and organizational commitment on absorptive capacity in pharmaceutical firms based in Pakistan","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044061686&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-04-2017-0132&partnerID=40&md5=28e3751f9ed6ca3d78d0b479e01f54ca","Purpose: Absorptive capacity being an emerging field of research has been studied in different perspectives both in technological aspects and soft issues. Although an original study of absorptive capacity placed employees as playing pivoting role in the development of absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), unfortunately, there are limited studies on behavior of employees toward this emerging construct. This study aims to explore the impact of employees’ behavior in the development of absorptive capacity. Specifically, impact of knowledge sharing, learning adaptability and organizational commitment on absorptive capacity has been evaluated in this study. Design/methodology/approach: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the pharmaceutical firms of Pakistan. The data were collected through random sampling from middle managers as a unit of analysis of this study. The rationale of the unit of analysis is that the maximum information is handled/accessed by the middle managers in the perspective of Pakistan. The data were collected from 170 respondents on a five-point Likert scale with the response rate of 66.7 per cent. Data were collected from different genders and different age groups with different qualification levels. Findings: All independent variables showed significant positive correlations with overall absorptive capacity (ACAP). At the same time, different relationships of all independent variables were found in different ways with different significant levels. The results showed that different strategies may be adopted to manage the external knowledge for competition in turbulent environment. For example, organizational commitment may be incorporated at strategy formulation only, whereas the Adaptability at both routine and strategy formulation stage. As all independent variables showed no correlation with Acquisition it is concluded that Acquisition is purely a routine function, and instead of coordination, the routine processes must be emphasized. Research limitations/implications: This study focused on the data from the middle managers of the pharmaceutical firms only. The results may not be generalized to the sectors. Another limitation is that the respondents of the study were middle managers. It was made intentional to see the impact of management aspects other than organizational mechanisms, as discussed by Cohen and Levinthal (1990) and Jansen et al. (2005) in their studies. The results on the basis of the data collected from other entities of the organization may differ. This is a cross-sectional study, and a longitudinal study may give different results. Practical implications: Absorptive capacity has the capability to absorb new knowledge and plays an important role in the development of organizational processes to compete in the turbulent environment. It is dependent not only on technological infrastructure but also on the employees’ behaviors and attitudes. This study gives insights about the knowledge process activities and employment of human resource at each phase of absorptive capacity in relation to their behaviors toward knowledge process. Social implications: Development of organizational process with knowledge management plays an important role in the capacity building, which ultimately enhances social paradigm of activities. Originality/value: Pharmaceutical companies in Pakistan acquire technologies from foreign countries and have very limited research and development of their own. As technology is upgraded by the foreign companies as a continuous improvement process, local firms of Pakistan are required to absorb the new knowledge with the same pace. The study highlights importance of human capital in the development of this capability. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature review, a theoretical framework is derived. Structural equation modeling was chosen for the empirical analysis based on the focus of the research. Data collection was conducted from 232 Indian manufacturing managers. Findings: The findings indicate that absorptive capacity has a positive impact on MC capability. Also, MC capability mediated the relationship between AMT and the financial and market performance. Furthermore, AMT positively impacted MC capability, and MC capability positively impacted both time to market and financial and market performance. AMT was not found to have a significant impact on financial and market performance. Originality/value: The current study is meaningful and unique in that no study has investigated the linkages between AMT, absorptive capacity, MC capability and organization performance and competitive advantage measures in a unified context. Such investigations are important because the results will encourage managers to invest in developing these mechanisms, which in turn will influence firm’s ability to implement MC practices and yield benefits such as improved performance and competitive advantage. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A field study was conducted among firms that are challenged by the disruptive nature of Cloud computing. Our results show that organizational design affects the degree of mobilization of an organization's affective, cognitive and behavioral resources, which in turn influence the effectiveness of learning processes related to the absorption and exchange of knowledge within the organization. Furthermore, they reveal the positive relationship between the enactment of absorptive capacity and the successful adoption of Cloud technology for incumbent firms. The findings contribute to our understanding of the micro-foundations of absorptive capacity and how positive organizational phenomena facilitate effective adoption and implementation of emerging technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd."

Grounded in the extended resource-based view, and using survey data from Chinese executives, we study the driver for, and test the impacts of, collaboration-specific investment and organizational learning on collaboration performance. Our findings indicate that resource similarity between the collaborative partners affects the level of collaboration-specific investment and learning, and demonstrate an approach that firms can use to obtain both abnormal common and private benefits from participation in an interorganizational collaboration. Specifically, the findings suggest that collaboration-specific investment has a direct effect on the enhancement of absorptive capacity and attainment of common and private collaboration benefits. Furthermore, due to the direct effect of absorptive capacity on attainment of collaboration benefits, commitment of collaboration-specific investment has an indirect effect on the attainment of common and private collaboration benefits. This study is the first to apply both the competence-capability framework and extended resource-based view to study interorganizational collaboration. In fact, this study aims to determine mechanisms for a collaboration-participating firm to obtain more benefit, whether common or private.

We explore this idea by assessing it as a predictor of absorptive capacity (ACAP) in cross-sector partnerships in pursuit of social innovation. The findings of our study indicate that aspects of strategic openness, including a shared sense of interdependence toward a mutual goal, are the primary mechanisms that enhance knowledge accretion in cross-sector partnerships. The data also suggest that formalized organizational mechanisms are more influential for producing ACAP than informal mechanisms. © 2018 International Council for Small Business."

Traditional command-and-control leadership can be ineffective in such chaotic environments. The purpose of this paper is to outline an alternative model to help leaders and organizations navigate effectively through VUCA environments. By developing three fundamental capacities (absorptive, adaptive and generative), leaders can cultivate organizations capable of continuous synchronization with their fitness landscapes. Central tenets of the framework include diversity, slack, learning, humility, reflection in action and abductive logic. Design/methodology/approach: This framework is designed based on literature insights, conceptual analysis and experts’ judgment. The paper integrates knowledge from a variety of disciplines and interprets them through the lens of complex adaptive systems. Findings: This paper argues for a process centered, contemplative approach to organizational leadership and development. By providing the underlying rationale for the proposed interventions (e.g. Ashby’s law of requisite variety), the paper also reorients busy leaders’ mental models to show why these time investments are worth implementing. Practical implications: This actionable framework can help leaders and organizations be more effective operating in a VUCA context. Originality/value: This paper provides a historic context as to why prediction and certainty are favored leadership strategies, why these approaches are no longer suitable and specific steps leaders can take to develop absorptive, adaptive and generative capacities to transform their organizations. Its scholarly contribution is the synthesis of disparate bodies of literature, weaving those multiple academic perspectives into a practical roadmap to enhance organizational leadership. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, the ideation process of the account planner is not well understood. Viewing account planning through a lens of absorptive capacity suggests that planning is about identifying and assimilating external information about consumers for use in the creative process. Account planners thus need to search deliberately for insight and work hard to express it to the creatives, who then exploit it to develop powerful creative ideas. The study adopts an in-depth grounded theory investigation of the insight phenomenon among 20 Sydney-based account planners. The findings reveal that identifying and applying insight is a highly creative process. The account planner uses research, personal knowledge domains, challenging conventions, borrowed sources, and central narrative extension to search for insights. However, because not all insights are equal, this study also uncovered what account planners consider quality insight. These include attributes of originality, relatability, usability, and vision. These findings provide guidelines for marketers and account planners who seek insight in framing an advertising message. © 2018, Copyright © 2018, American Academy of Advertising."

Using data collected from 112 manufacturing firms, we found a positive effect of top management support of learning and employee learning orientation on AC and subsequent firm innovative performance. Further, we found that decentralization moderated the effect of top management support of learning on innovative performance via AC such that the indirect effect was significant only when decentralization was higher. However, we did not find that the indirect effect of employee learning orientation on innovative performance via AC varied significantly as a function of decentralization structure. This study extends the AC literature by highlighting the importance of managerial learning-supportive practices and employee learning orientation, and by revealing how decentralization structure facilitates the organization and employees to translate the learning support and learning motivation to AC and innovation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The analysis focuses on the impact generated from these collaboration programs to promote innovation. Data for the analysis was obtained through a measurement instrument, which allows evaluating multiple dimensions of capacity of absorption as determinants of the innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology consisted of the implementation of the measurement instrument for the managers in the companies who were involved in the collaborative projects. From the answers obtained, an analysis of strengths and weaknesses was performed, categorized by absorptive capacity dimensions, satisfaction with linkage relationship and innovative impact. In addition, a comparative exercise is presented with the purpose of learning the position of the Postgraduate Program in Industrial Engineering in México, and finally, an analysis of Spearman’s coefficient was performed to verify whether the linkage influenced innovation for this case study. Findings: There is a positive correlation between linkage and innovation. An unexpected finding was the level of satisfaction of the companies that collaborated with the academy and the real situation of each dimension to determine the improvements in the policies and mechanisms of linkage. Research limitations/implications: One of the main challenges of this paper was to identify and contact the managers of the projects. These projects have been performed and completed in several companies from 2011 to date. Over this time, some managers have changed their employment status and even their places of residence. Therefore, establishing contact and performing interviews with the managers directly linked to each project was a complex process. Originality/value: This is the first paper that demonstrates and measures the relationship between linkage and innovation through an instrument of absorptive capacity, which determines the behavior of each dimension where strengths and weaknesses of collaboration relationships are detected and determines the punctual impact on innovation from the perspective of the businessmen involved. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Drawing from the resource –based view and the dynamic capabilities perspective, this study proposes a moderated mediation model in which channel management capability of an IJV helps transform the potential benefits of knowledge transfer into performance, and such indirect effect is augmented by absorptive capacity of an IJV and market dynamism it faces. Using a sample of 136 China-based IJVs, findings revealed that the mediation effect of channel management capability is particularly salient and becomes stronger when an IJV faces a more dynamic market environment or when the IJV has a relatively higher absorptive capacity.

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework is empirically tested in a field study with multi-source data collected from a sample of 297 manufacturing firms located in four. Manufacturing clusters in the south-eastern Yangtze River Delta of China. Hypotheses were tested with the use of path analysis with maximum likelihood robust estimates through the structural equation modelling approach. Findings: The asymmetry between local network ties (LNT) and global network ties (GNT) in terms of influences on firms’ innovation performance is confirmed by empirical tests. LNT not only significantly and positively contribute to firms’ innovation performance directly but also enhance it indirectly via absorptive capability, whereas GNT exhibit only marginal influence on innovation performance. GNT are shown to boost innovation performance (IP) only indirectly via firms’ absorptive capacities. Knowledge heterogeneity and the difference between domestic and multinational firms’ institutional environment are considered to be the main causes of the asymmetric effects. Originality/value: While the previous literature either focused on the mediating role of firms’ knowledge absorptive capacities or investigated the effects of social networks separately, this study incorporates both mechanisms into a single analytical framework to better account for the interactions between network effects and absorptive capacities. The results challenge some previous studies positing that GNT are stronger determinants than LNT in shaping a local firm’s innovation capacity in emerging economies, and the findings emphasize the importance of absorptive capacity in helping local enterprises to leverage external linkages to enhance firm’s innovation performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the hypotheses with a sample of 87 knowledge worker teams involving 393 employees and employers in China. Findings: Knowledge hiding is negatively related to team creativity, fully mediated by absorptive capacity. In addition, the negative relationship between knowledge hiding and absorptive capacity would be weakened by task interdependence. Practical implications: Team managers should take measures to avoid the development of knowledge hiding, which is indirectly related to team creativity via absorptive capacity within a team, and motivate team members to share more knowledge by training to improve their feelings of accountability, responsibility, and duty. In addition, managers can decrease knowledge hiding by strengthening within-team task interdependence. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to investigate the relationship between knowledge hiding and team creativity and the moderating role of task interdependence in the relationship between knowledge hiding and absorptive capacity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Transformational leadership influence on unit performance: Cross-level moderated mediation evidence","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047381272&doi=10.1108%2fLODJ-08-2017-0224&partnerID=40&md5=1faa1dce7396abc9549a734ab9f81b73","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of mediation and moderation mechanisms between firm-level effects of transformational leadership (TFL) on unit-level performance across levels. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used surveys to collect data from 800 senior managers at the firm level and 1,377 unit managers from 800 units of 100 firms from semiconductors, optoelectronics, computer electronics, and telecommunications industries. The industries were chosen because these firms focus on expanding their businesses and encourage extensive knowledge sharing among the firms and at all levels within the organizations. Findings: In this study, the authors theorized that firm-level effects of TFL on unit-level performance across levels were positively related to unit-level performance. Unit-level knowledge sharing mediates the positive relationship between firm-level TFL and unit-level performance. A cross-level interaction effect of firm-level TFL and unit-level absorptive capacity showed that a positive unit-level absorptive capacity enhanced firm-level influence of TFL on unit-level knowledge sharing. Unit-level absorptive capacity moderates the positive relationship between unit-level knowledge sharing and unit-level performance. Originality/value: First, the authors attempt to integrate the leadership and knowledge management research by exploring the critical mediator of unit-level knowledge sharing in explaining the effects of firm-level TFL on employees’ performance at the unit level. This approach is important because it extends the research areas of the two fields, and also clarifies issues regarding how and why TFL at the top of the organization positively impacts the performance of employees at a lower level of the organizational hierarchy. Second, the effectiveness of firm-level TFL depends on the absorptive capacity of each unit. The importance of absorptive capacity and the consequences of leadership behaviors have been emphasized in studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As such, acquisition success greatly depends on the expeditious leveraging of target knowledge. Confounding our understanding of leveraging target knowledge is that targets play two distinct innovative roles post-acquisition: conduct innovative activities in conjunction with acquirers (integrative innovation) and continue innovative activities independent of acquirers (independent innovation). To understand how factors differentially affect these two types of innovation, I connect two disparate concepts: relative absorptive capacity and selective intervention. I develop theory and find evidence that while relative absorptive capacity creates the communication capabilities that accelerate integrative innovation, it simultaneously deteriorates the information asymmetries between targets and acquirers leading to greater opportunities for acquirer intervention into target innovative activities that delay independent innovation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Absorptive capacity is an important dynamic capability that enables organizations to leverage external knowledge for innovation purposes. In this theory-building article, we address the fundamental research question of how organizations can leverage external partners as external sources of knowledge. We offer three primary contributions to the literature on managerial decision-making. First, by conceptualizing knowledge absorption as a collaborative, interorganizational endeavor, we extend the literature on absorptive capacity, thereby enabling its application to innovation-related contexts aside from R&D, to which it has traditionally been applied. Second, by focusing on social integration mechanisms as links between the capabilities, expertise, and knowledge of individuals, groups, and the organization as a whole, we heed calls to clarify the microfoundations of organizational capabilities. Third, although social integration is a multidimensional construct, few studies have addressed the influence of its individual dimensions. We outline how individual social integration dimensions exert differing influences on the individual knowledge absorption stages, thereby taking a first step toward unraveling the multidimensional nature of social integration and laying the foundation for future social integration research both in and beyond the absorptive capacity context. © 2018 Decision Sciences Institute."

Prior VUCA research identified frequent and rapid knowledge acquisition, pattern and trend recognition and cause and effect analysis as organizational learning imperatives which must be strategically considered. In response to increased disruption of VUCA environments, design thinking has gained popularity and widespread acceptance as a method to facilitate speed and frequency of organizational learning. This study approached design thinking from an absorptive capacity perspective to describe and document the perspectives of subject matter experts on how design thinking promotes organizational learning in VUCA environments. The present findings reveal design thinking learning structures increase the speed and efficiency of absorptive capacity and organizational learning. In return, this increased speed and efficiency results in faster decision making and innovation to pre-empt disruptive VUCA environments. As such, this study advocates for a re-conceptualization of design thinking from a problem solving and innovation construct into an organizational learning construct. This re-conceptualization will aide in removing vague definition and ambiguity from the concept while allowing for richer theory building and broader application of design thinking in a variety of contexts. © 2018, Allied Academies."

We argue that the impact on the productivity of local upstream and downstream companies differs due to the heterogeneity of services. We investigate a sample of foreign MNEs located in Italy, finding that: (i) local suppliers enjoy positive spillovers from MNEs in highly innovative services; (ii) local customers enjoy positive spillovers from MNEs in service sector that stimulate interactions and generate redeploy able knowledge; (Hi) suppliers and customers with higher absorptive capacity enjoy higher benefits from MNEs in service sectors whose internationalization process is at an early stage. Our findings confirm that indirect effects come from countervailing forces associated to intra-industry spillovers, whose net effect depends on the characteristics of the services considered. © Vilnius University, 2002-2018. © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2018. © University of Latvia, 2002-2018."

Capturing the essence of dynamic capabilities and understanding what they are and how they actually support technological innovation and change, however, has hitherto posed an exacting challenge. This paper addresses these issues; 1) by reviewing the current state of research; 2) by investigating the role of three established theoretical lenses - ambidexterity, absorptive capacity and technology management - for dynamic capability-driven adaptation to technological change. In particular, we analyse how these three concepts unfold as dynamic capabilities and facilitate technological change through strategic managerial decision-making, resource reconfiguration and continuous learning. We subsequently propose a comprehensive framework that provides an integrative perspective on how dynamic capabilities support the management of technological change, e.g. developments toward digital transformation, new ICTs or cyber physical systems. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on the findings of our synthesis and framework. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

A benchmarking concept compares science, technology and innovation (STI) policies across countries taking into account country absorptive capacities, performance in GVCs and the way these policies are embedded in the national STI policy context. Data cover selected OECD and emerging economies drawing on the EC/OECD STI Policy database. An exploratory text-as-data approach is taken. National policy mixes for GVC integration and technology upgrading seem to be developed on the basis of prior positioning in GVCs. Policy mixes are polymorphs in so far as they combine different instruments across different policy domains with different functions according to national structural features and comparative advantages. While essential, especially to technology upgrading, industrial and cluster policies are not the only channels of policy intervention. Foreign direct investment (FDI)-related policies and initiatives in support of the internationalisation of firms and universities also appear to be key. Financial instruments remain the most popular policy tools for supporting integration into GVCs and countries combine a broad range of funding mechanisms with international investment promotion activities and the deployment of networking and world-class research facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

The aim of this paper is to determine the drivers of SME exploration-exploitation alliance domains. The study combines the parallel perspectives on motives-Antecedents of SME alliances and the domains of exploration-exploitation to provide an integrated theoretical model. Specifically, the paper aims to determine the likely conditions which cause SMEs to opt for exploration or exploitation in each of the domains. Findings indicate that a combination of motives and antecedents at all three levels - firm-level, partner-level, and environmental-level, affect the three domains of SME exploration-exploitation alliances, namely functional, structural and attribute. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

To this end, we investigate the strategic behaviour of two Bangladeshi garment manufacturers. Both started out as small suppliers for multinational enterprises (MNEs) and have eventually grown into micro-multinationals. The firms are involved in ‘tacit promissory contracting’ with their buyers, a specific form of international outsourcing relationship. The study adopts a multiple case study design that involves interviews with managers/owners of the firms. The analysis yields two key findings. Both firms have devised strategies and taken coherent routines involving actions to develop skills and motivation needed to perform appropriate functional activities (i.e. pre-production, production and post-production) as they embarked on different stages of upgrading. Furthermore, firms have designed routines to internalise the challenges originating from their relationships with their buyers and the institutional environment at the time that had the potential to affect their upgrading goals. The paper contributes to IB studies by highlighting how suppliers, even in a precarious context, can control their own strategies and routines, so as to develop capabilities that allow them to gradually redress the power imbalance between themselves and their buyers. © 2018 The Authors"

It achieves this by analysing the work of Big Four audit firms in Luxembourg, where three official languages co-exist: Luxembourgish, French, and German. In addition, expatriates bring with them their native languages in a corporate environment that uses English as its lingua franca. Design/methodology/approach: The paper combines the institutionalist sociology of the professions with theoretical concepts from sociolinguistics to study the multifaceted role of language in PSFs. Empirically, the paper draws from 25 interviews with current and former audit professionals. Findings: The client orientation of the Big Four segments each firm into language teams based on the client’s language. It is thus the client languages, rather than English as the corporate language, that mediate, define, and structure intra- and inter-organizational relationships. While the firms emphasize the benefits of their linguistic adaptability, the paper reveals tensions along language lines, suggesting that language can be a means of creating cohesion and division within the firms. Originality/value: This paper connects research on PSFs with that on the role of language in multinational organizations. In light of the Big Four’s increasingly global workforce, it draws attention to the linguistic divisions within the firms that question the existence of a singular corporate culture. While prior literature has centred on firms’ global–local divide, the paper shows that even single branches of such firm networks are not monolithic constructs, as conflicts and clashes unfold amid a series of “local–local” divides. © 2018, Dominic Detzen and Lukas Loehlein."

The main advantages that social capital management provide to this company are: (1) the development of strong and close ties with other firms and institutions for the purposes of knowledge exchange (development of structural social capital), (2) the achievement of a high reliability in its business relationships (development of relational social capital), and (3) the establishment of compatible objectives and shared cultural values with a number of external agents (development of cognitive social capital). In turn, this case study shows that the way social capital is strategically managed by a firm is an essential aspect for the successful development of knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the success of the integration and use of the knowledge acquired depends strongly on the firm’s capability to correctly identify, assess, and anticipate the potential value of such external knowledge.

Endogenous factors associated with a path-dependent evolution of the knowledge network are jointly considered with a firm’s development of international relationships and increasing internal absorptive capacity over time.

Estimation results were obtained using moderated regression analysis. Findings: Firms that increase their involvement in knowledge networks over time also tend to increase their innovative capacity. However, efforts devoted to building international links or absorptive capacity negatively moderate the impact of network growth on innovation. Practical implications: Practitioners have two alternative ways of increasing innovation inside knowledge networks: they can increase their centrality by developing their knowledge network interactions or invest in developing their internal absorptive capacity and new international sources of knowledge. Investing in both of these simultaneously does not seem to improve a firm’s innovative capacity. Originality/value: Coupling firms’ strategic options with knowledge network dynamics provide a more complete way of explaining how firms can improve their innovative capacity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Empirical data come from paper and patent citations and financial information in biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms. Results show that scientific knowledge alone has a positive effect on firms' financial performance. A firm's tendency to combination familiar and older technological knowledge amplifies the positive effect of scientific knowledge.

In this case, they adopt a knowledge acquisition strategy to foster innovation, reducing risk and exploiting new technological opportunities. This underlines a shift in the role of universities from education providers to scientific knowledge and technologies producers in the current knowledge-driven economy. In this context, the main goal of this paper is to assess the impact of knowledge acquisition on firms' innovation commercialisation, with a specific focus on knowledge developed by university scientific research.

Design/methodology/approach: Using panel data of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2010, the authors first used data envelopment analysis to measure regional innovation efficiency, followed by a spatial panel model to test research hypotheses concerning the effect of FDI on regional innovation efficiency and the direct and moderating effects of regional characteristics such as regional innovation environment, regional absorptive capacity and regional complementary assets. Findings: The paper finds that there are considerable inter-regional and intra-regional variations in innovation efficiency in China and that regional variations in innovation efficiency in China can first be explained by the differences in inflow FDI and then be accounted for by the direct and moderating effect of regional innovation environment, absorptive capacity and complementary assets. Research limitations/implications: The research findings have three policy implications. First, governments should continue their efforts to increase the transparency and predictability of the framework for inward FDI and align FDI with the region’s strategic priorities of development to improve innovation efficiency. Second, governments should develop holistic and coherent policies that address the key aspects of regional conditions conducive to the inflow of FDI. Third, governments at the regional level should cultivate an open innovation environment and support the development of financial markets to maximize the positive effect of FDI technology spillover and externalities.

As countries are integrated into these global networks (GNs), they are forced to rethink a broad array of policies. A fundamental tension needs to be addressed between global knowledge sourcing, which requires trade liberalization, and domestic capability development, which requires supporting industry and innovation policies. To reap innovation gains from GNs, countries need to address simultaneously two challenges. From the “outside,” national policies have to deal with a multitude of bilateral and regional trade agreements (RTAs) and attempts to establish a new architecture of megaregional trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), that seek to create and harmonize new international benchmark standards for national policies, rules and regulations, for example, for intellectual property, technical standardization, government procurement, taxation, and competition policy. National policies need to take into account these changes in the governance of the international economy (as demonstrated throughout the book). This chapter focuses on a second set of challenges that originate from the “inside”: countries differ in their capabilities to learn and innovate, and hence they differ in their capacity to capture potential gains from integration into GPNs and GINs. The chapter outlines a conceptual framework and describes the research needed to trace the dissemination (or lack thereof) of innovation resources and capabilities through knowledge-sharing within those networks that span developed and developing worlds. The analysis focuses on the experience of China and other leading Asian electronics manufacturing exporting countries. All of these countries are deeply integrated into international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) through GPNs, and in some cases, through GINs. The author argues that research on GNs needs to move beyond value capture. Instead more effort should be invested in exploring whether and how integration into these networks might foster or erode a country’s absorptive capacity and firmlevel innovation capabilities. The chapter reviews what is known about driving forces and characteristics of GPNs and GINs and highlights the increasing diversity and complexity of these networks in the electronics industry. To establish whether GN integration might foster or erode the host country’s absorptive capacity and firm-level innovation capabilities, three scenarios are considered: (i) the “Gains from Trade” effect; (ii) the “Domestic Disintegration” effect; (iii) the “Innovation Trap” effect; and (iv) the “Limits to Modularity” effect. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Local expansion processes of dutch firms in central and eastern Europe","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049215271&doi=10.4324%2f9781315191355&partnerID=40&md5=b0dd50df593afcc943f0961043dff0d3","The decisions firms make in their international expansion processes are subject to extended research rooted in very diverse theoretical approaches. The starting point of this chapter is the internationalization decisions of firms that are dependent upon previous decisions (Aharoni, 1966). Every expansion is seen as a step for further international expansions (see for instance, Kogut, 1983; Wernerfelt, 1984). Firms gather experiences with every step and add to their knowledge base or absorptive capacity. Firms with an increasing absorptive capacity are more prone to recognize and internalize new learning possibilities (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Experiential learning is the driving force of the internationalization process according to the evolutionary approach (or Uppsala model) of internationalization (Johanson and Vahlne, 1977; Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul, 1975; Welch and Luostarinen, 1988). Gathering market knowledge reduces uncertainty and allows the firm to gradually enter an increasing number of foreign countries, using entry modes that are characterized by augmenting resource commitments, at an increasing psychic distance to their home country (Johanson and Vahlne, 1977). With respect to growing resource commitment four stages were distinguished called the ‘establishment chain’, along which the firm expands in local markets (Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul, 1975). It has been questioned later, however, whether the steps proposed by the establishment chain are still valid in the current globalizing world (Hedlund and Kverneland, 1983; Nordstrom, 1991; Turnbull, 1987). Welch and Luostarinen (1988) made a contribution to the evolutionary approach by introducing a framework with six dimensions along which the internationalizing firm is expected to develop. This framework is used as a starting point for this chapter. Its goal is to investigate the patterns Dutch firms have used to enter the newly opened markets of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The aim of the chapter is to contribute to the knowledge of the internationalization process of firms within host countries. Sequential steps taken by Dutch firms in the CEE region are investigated and a test for the establishment chain in the context of modern time in a new market is presented (Bridgewater, 1999). © Marin Alexandrov Marinov 2002."
"Firm capabilities, technological dynamism and the internationalisation of innovation: A behavioural approach","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028762074&doi=10.1057%2fs41267-017-0101-0&partnerID=40&md5=1e37de4b8dd237b4b8861e5e17092c73","We develop a behavioural framework of bounded rational decision-making under uncertainty to analyse the role of technological dynamism in the firm's environment for its decision to internationalise innovation. Applying prospect theory, we argue that technological uncertainty in the firm's environment affects its risk preferences differently depending on its technological capabilities. A key prediction is that firms with low capabilities will internationalise innovation when faced by technological uncertainty while firms with high capabilities will concentrate their innovation at the home-base. We also argue that our behavioural approach based on prospect theory is not a stand-alone programme but benefits from the integration with traditional concepts in IB. In particular, we make a case that organisational measures fostering absorptive capacity, such as intensive personnel exchange between headquarters and subsidiaries, can help to attenuate the high-capability firms' tendency to concentrate innovation at the home-base when faced by high uncertainty. We corroborate the predictions of our framework based on data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey. © 2017 Academy of International Business."

"A multidimensional approach to the content of human capital: Dimensions, emergence process and organizational capabilities","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053064878&doi=10.1108%2fMRJIAM-05-2016-0666&partnerID=40&md5=14146c461e64fbdd72074e78893d4074","Purpose: Using a multilevel approach, this theoretical paper aims to build a framework to explore the cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions of human capital, which may in turn explain how they become a source of competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents several propositions to be empirically tested in further research using multilevel analysis. Starting at the individual level, four configurations of human capital are determined by considering cognitive and non-cognitive human capital. Based on these settings, interactions of human capital at intermediate or departmental level are discussed, taking into account the complexity of the task environment and psychosocial processes. These interactions constitute microfoundations, which explain why human capital may influence different types of organizational capabilities. Findings: The theoretical analysis carried out allows proposing four configurations of human capital, combining individual cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions. These configurations form a human capital portfolio classifying different types of employees. In addition, this paper shows how individual human capital aggregates into departmental level and generates human capital emergence processes by contextualizing through the complex task environments and psychosocial processes. The development of these emergence processes enables proposing the association of certain organizational capabilities with cognitive elements of human capital (absorptive capacity, innovativeness and technical capacities), whereas a second group of organizational capabilities is linked to non-cognitive human capital aspects (organizational commitment, leadership and customer intimacy). Originality/value: This paper combines individual dimensions in the study of the content of human capital from a multilevel and microfoundational approach, explaining the effects of emerging human capital on different organizational capabilities when human capital is contextualized at departmental level. This theoretical paper is a new step towards understanding and measuring the concept of human capital, enriching the resource-based view framework. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Institutional knowledge: Acquisition, assimilation and exploitation in internationalisation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046338310&doi=10.1108%2fIMR-05-2016-0111&partnerID=40&md5=e04236eb0317781ecac7fa1212a48fbd","Purpose: Rarely have studies on the acquisition of knowledge in internationalisation focused on institutional knowledge. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to investigate the acquisition of this knowledge, and its assimilation and exploitation processes in internationalisation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilises ten longitudinal revelatory case studies built from multiple semi-structured interviews conducted with three different firm types of small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) in the pharmaceutical industry and secondary documents to which the researchers obtained proprietary access. Findings: The study enhances the conceptual understanding of the institutional learning process in internationalisation by, for the first time, developing a framework to characterise this process. The study explores and identifies multiple types of institutional knowledge required, the sequencing of their acquisition, sources and learning methods utilised. It also discusses transferability of this learning across foreign markets and firms’ absorptive capacity for that knowledge. Regulatory-specific product knowledge, found to be the most important type required, appeared to affect significantly both market selection and mode of entry, and when acquired insufficiently, prevented internationalisation. Research limitations/implications: While the sample size is relatively small, and sector-specific, the findings were consistent across all the SME firms and firm types. They may also be generalisable to other sectors, firm sizes such as MNEs and types, particularly those which are knowledge-based or highly regulated, given that similar institutional knowledge and processes of acquisition are necessary for firms of all sizes in internationalisation. Practical implications: International marketing managers will gain valuable insights, based on a framework proven to propel firms to successful internationalisation, upon how to plan, organise, manage and match their institutional knowledge-seeking and learning activities with their firms’ internal capabilities, staffing and other resources in an effective and timely manner. Originality/value: This study contributes to the conceptual understanding of the institutional knowledge learning process in the internationalisation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Recently resilience has also gained importance within tourism and more specifically within the context of tourism destinations (Cochrane, 2010; Dahles & Susilowati, 2015; Luthe & Wyss, 2014). Tourism destinations - interpreted as complex systems (Baggio, Scott, & Cooper, 2010; Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004) - are constantly exposed to different types of disturbances. These can include gradually emerging stressors as well as abruptly originating shocks (Lew, 2014; Walker, Carpenter, Rockstrom, Crépin, & Peterson, 2012), which moreover can have different effects within the social, ecological and economic dimensions of the destination. The aim of this article is to introduce the concepts of “Engineering Resilience” (Holling, 1973), “Ecological Resilience” (Holling, 1996) and “Evolutionary Resilience” (Davoudi, 2012) and to understand existing tourism literature on destination resilience according to these different approaches. Moreover, by focusing on the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities of systems connected to the different connotations of resilience (Béné, Wood, Newsham, & Davies, 2012) the authors endeavor to generate different perspectives on how resilience can be approached and measured at destination level. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Elisa Innerhofer, Martin Fontanari and Harald Pechlaner; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Technology roadmap for social banking","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037048681&doi=10.1108%2fJSTPM-07-2017-0029&partnerID=40&md5=6d5c69163635c9da964030b5ac4af35c","Purpose: This research presents a technology roadmap for social banking in Iran. Technology roadmapping is a tool for decisionmakers to identify, assess and choose between different strategic options to achieve the best technological objectives and help companies and industries to better understand their market and technological choices. As social banking is in its infancy, it could embody different aspects. Therefore, to be successful in field of social banking, banks should define specific capabilities based on their capacities to create their own model. A social banking roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for banks to design products and services based on their capacities and create required programs for their implementation and improvement. Design/methodology/approach: This paper outlines the steps for creating a technology roadmap to develop social banking services of one of Iran’s private banks. Different methods were used to implement each step mainly based on expert panels and carrying out polling and survey research among banking and IT experts. Findings: Technology roadmaps pay special attention to the challenges and the level of capabilities (both technical and social) to develop technologies and services specially for developing countries. The level of capabilities and absorptive capacity will determine the direction of technology development. Hence, banks should design their business plan and roadmap based on their background and capabilities, state of market, their status and goals. Policymakers should help increase cooperation, financial transparency, information and payments security via appropriate legislations. Research limitations/implications: The number of banks that have entered the social banking field is limited, and as a result, activities that have been carried out in this area in the country are limited too. Therefore, there was limited access to information as well as related studies. This research has tried to extract all the contents of the roadmap. Some sub-topics such as technologies have been dealt with to a lesser depth because of the complexity in identifying and assigning each of technologies to the service features. The technology roadmap experiences in the country are limited, and it was not possible to study the existing roadmaps with regard to their confidentiality. Developing a technology roadmap requires using expert panels and conducting multiple workshops with stakeholders from private sectors, universities and industries. In this research, because of low resources, the panels were confronted with limited continuous attendance as well as the accumulation of different stakeholders. Practical implications: The research results provided strategies to inform, encourage and finance banks and other businesses to use social networks appropriately and effectively. These strategies can be categorized into the actions banks should take to expand social banking in the country and the actions policymakers should take into account in this regard. They are described as follows. Banks’ strategic actions include: provide training to staff on how employees should interact with customers on social networks encompassing general information and education about services, benefits and how to use social banking services for customers and society; motivate customer participation in social banking networks; convergence and integration of various offline and online channels; focus on core banking to expand competitiveness; pay attention to sustainable and green development in providing social banking services; analysis of the competitive environment in banking and other financial industries; designing a portfolio of social services for customers and allocation of budget and resources for development of social banking services and participation with other institutions and operators in providing financial and non-financial services. Policymakers’ actions include: adopt motivational policies for participation and use of social networks; education and awareness for different stakeholders; review and update the policies and rules of IT and social networks; establish appropriate laws to protect rights of employees and customers; invest in market and university studies on social banking and related services; develop policies for using in-house software and update rules and policies for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Originality/value: Social banking is in its infancy in Iran and few banks deliver services of social banking in a limited scope. There is no technology roadmap for this purpose in Iran. This research presents a technology roadmap for social banking in Iran (and can be adopted for banks of other developing countries) and gives a comprehensive plan for banks to design products and services based on their capacities and create required programs to implement and improve them. The application of technology roadmapping in the field of social banking is new. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The ability to access and successfully use knowledge is at the heart of absorptive capacity. The main purpose of this empirical study is to investigate the importance of awareness as an antecedent dimension of the concept of absorptive capacity of manufacturing SMEs from aerospace and advanced engineering industry in the UK. The study will also attempt to explore the impact of awareness on the other dimensions of absorptive capacity. Awareness is related to the importance, motivation and interest of learning and innovating. Our study, which focuses on internal processes adopts a mixed method approach and is based on the data collected from 43 SMEs. Our finding suggests that awareness as an antecedent dimension can play a vital role in helping SMEs to improve their knowledge-based resources through changes within their internal organisational and cognitive processes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Using the theoretical lens of social capital theory and knowledge-based view of a firm; we propose a framework of antecedents and consequences of socialisation. We use data from a large sample of firms in Australia to test our framework. We also corroborate our results with a small sample of qualitative case studies that were carried out in conjunction with the large-scale empirical study. Taken together, the results supported the claim of the importance of socialisation as well as absorptive capacity in influencing innovation performance of buyers. The results suggest that managers ought to consider socialisation as a mechanism to enhance collaborative competence which in turn helps innovation performance via tapping the potential of absorptive capacity of knowledge. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

And (2) What are the effects of local firms’ PAC and RAC on their innovation outcomes? Based on survey data collected from 297 Chinese firms engaged in GBS cooperation in China’s Yangtze River Delta region, we test our research hypotheses with the structural equation modelling approach. The empirical findings indicate that both structural and relational SC are important antecedents of PAC and RAC in global buyer–supplier relationships. More specifically, RAC not only improves local suppliers’ new product performance, but also fully mediates the relationship between PAC and new product performance. Our results have two major implications for practicing managers. First, local suppliers in emerging economies need to pay more attention to SC embedded in GBS relationships for it is an important means for them to overcome resource constraints and therefore to improve their new product performance. Second, it is important for managers in local firms to continuously improve their PAC to better assess and assimilate external knowledge, and extend their RAC to upgrade their interpretation and comprehension of commercialization possibilities, which allows for generating synergy of knowledge recombination with existing core competencies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

In particular, two main learning processes are considered: the explorative and the transformative learning. To develop the model, the Ising approach, which is a very well established framework to study the dynamics of social interactions, is employed. Furthermore, a simulation analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of two patterns and four levels of social interactions on the firm absorptive capacity. Results show that block-diagonal patterns, where interactions occur inside groups and not between groups (such as in modular organizations), lead to higher absorptive capacity, compared to hierarchical patterns (e.g., those exhibited by centralized organizations). We also show that the relationship between the level of social interactions and the firm absorptive capacity follows an inverted-U shape in the block-diagonal patterns, while the absorptive capacity decreases as the level of interactions rises, in the hierarchical patterns. Finally, we find that the social network also plays a moderating role on the relationship between the complementary knowledge and the firm absorptive capacity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Implementation of sustainability requires the ability to acknowledge external (sustainability-related) knowledge, and to apply it in intra-company activities such as purchasing. We focus on absorptive capacities as potential drivers of sustainability, and investigate the effect that a purchasing function's capacity to absorb and process knowledge has on social and environmental sustainability practices, and subsequently on economic performance in purchasing. We compare MNCs and non-MNCs using a structural equation model of a large set of survey data from four European countries and find that only realized absorptive capacities impact sustainability practices in purchasing and this impact is smaller in MNCs than in other companies. We suggest that companies respond to the demand for sustainability by strengthening their implementation capabilities: the potential to acquire and transform knowledge within a purchasing function is less relevant, and what matters is its application. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

While ‘slicing’ of global value chains has received attention in previous research, the parallel disaggregation of management activities has not. Our longitudinal study of 374 RHQ between 1998 and 2010 redresses this omission by asking why RHQ lose their mandates. We apply the concept of absorptive capacity and find two different explanatory mechanisms for full and partial mandate loss driven by RHQ-specific capabilities and location-specific capabilities. Full mandate loss is associated with deficient RHQ-specific capabilities and realised absorptive capacity. By contrast, partial mandate loss is driven by an RHQ's lack of the location-specific capabilities to respond to local changes, leading to removal of mandates for some subunits only. The distinction between full and partial loss offers a more nuanced and granular explanation of how geographic regions of MNCs are composed. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies"

UIC policies are examined within a multidimensional innovation policy framework that encompasses five Science and Technology Basic Plans and a vast array of support measures for venture business, intellectual property, innovation networks and business promotion, all reflecting an extensive top-down government intervention with ambitious goals. A dense network of UIC centres has been established throughout the country, mostly in universities, and these centres are tightly embedded in regional innovation structures. In spite of the sustained government policy intervention, Japan lags behind the United States and Europe in a ranking of the top 20 global ecosystems and has some of the world’s lowest entrepreneurial indicators, as defined by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. The authors argue that a likely cause for the lag is Japan’s slow and still incomplete transition from a ‘traditional’ innovation system to a modern innovation ecosystem with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and culture, effective intermediaries between university and industry, high absorptive capacity in companies using academic research, cross-boundary mobility of workforce and ideas and global outreach. The experience of Osaka University and Hokkaido University, two UIC leaders in Japan and internationally, supports this hypothesis. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

Several environmental experts argue that firms can respond to environmental regulations through innovation; however, the question of how to innovate is unanswered in the environmental literature. Therefore, this study focuses on the open innovation strategy approach to respond to environmental regulations and maintain high productivity by incorporating the idea of innovation management. We first divide open innovation strategy into two modes of external technology acquisition: foreign and domestic. Next, we examine these modes' mediation effects on environmental regulations and productivity. In addition, we test the moderating effect of internal R&D on the relationship between external technology acquisition and productivity. Using data on 35 Chinese industrial sectors from 2001 to 2010, the empirical findings show that foreign technology significantly and positively mediates the link between environmental regulations and productivity, while domestic technology does not. Internal R&D investment, as an absorptive capacity, positively moderates the effect of foreign technology; however, it negatively moderates the effect of domestic technology on productivity.

Rather than using the standard but fragmented system of counties, this small post-transition economy is first mapped into five regions following the concept of regional innovation systems (RISs). Essentially, RIS concept rests on an idea that interactions among regional agents lead to the creation of optimal innovation output, while policy based on Smart specialisation strategy in Croatia is a national policy that promotes creation of innovative products and services in five promising domains and 13 sub-thematic areas. Analysis is carried out in two steps, firstly using a data-driven approach employed in a multidimensional framework for assessing regional accessibility, absorptive capacity and diffusion of knowledge in the context of Smart specialisation strategy (S3) implementation. In the second step, the assumption of post-transition reliance on the external knowledge and technology in producing innovation output is examined via regional presence of high-technology firms, GDP per capita and international trade and investment variables and patents per 100.000 inhabitants using cluster analysis (Ward method). The results show that highly internationalised regions with higher density of hightechnology firms already produce relatively more innovation output per capita. With already favourable conditions in place, these progressive regions are most likely to reinforce their competitive advantages through the transformation of their economic structures enabled by implementation of S3. © 2017, UNIVRIJEKA.

Although research in the field of absorption capacity was globally initiated more than two and a half decades ago, the same was not at all the case with Eastern European firms. Considering that, the research objective of this paper arises: what is the level of the absorptive capacity in technology driven Croatian firms and how does it catalyse their innovation outputs? Our specific objectives are to measure the integrated level of the absorptive capacity (ACAP) with respect to all its constituent components; assimilation, acquisition, transformation and exploitation. Such an ACAP measured value will be tabulated against the innovation outputs of firms and their business performances. To achieve these objectives a selected population of more than 200 Croatian firms that are dealing technology development was defined as a sample and asked to fill the questionnaire. Forty five of them that have fully responded were tested against formulated hypothesis ultimately proving that the higher level of ACAP is somehow positively driving their innovation performances. © 2017 PICMET."

This paper objective is to analyze Netflix change in technological fields through the time and compare these changes with two strategic moments, start to provide VOD service and the decision to go global. Two research questions are proposed 1) which are Netflix's technological capabilities in time, 2) How the technological capabilities change in the two strategical moments, Netflix start of provision of VOD service in 2007 and Netflix decision to provide services abroad in 2010. Longitudinal systematic descriptive analysis of Netflix's patents IPC codes is done, in order to get some insights of NETFLIX's change of technological capabilities in time. Three changes in Netflix technological capabilities were detected, 2000-2006 as an IT based retailer, when started to provide VOD service in 2007-2009 it had a technological focus on TV digital processing and parallel processing and as last 2010-2013 when they announced to start providing international VOD service, their patents' focus was TV digital processing, data processing systems and communication infrastructure. © 2017 IEEE."

To develop such ecosystems, numerous countries have provided significant inducements to multinational enterprises (MNEs) to attract them to locate their operations within their borders. Despite the rise in MNEs’ entry, evidence on their efficacy in invigorating local entrepreneurial systems has been mixed. We propose that this may arise from a lack of focus on local ecosystems’ absorptive capacity, which is essential to spawning different types of entrepreneurial ventures that combine both replicative (imitative) and truly innovative local firms. This occurs as local entrepreneurs in proceed to capture, assimilate, and exploit MNEs’ different knowledge spillovers. Further, we argue that the dynamic interplay between knowledge flows through spillovers from MNEs and absorptive capacity is likely to promote the emergence, evolution, and sustainability of different types of new local firms—in some cases creating conformity and lock-ins and in others enhancing the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial activities. Over time, these developments encourage co-specialization between local new ventures and MNEs. Our analyses highlight key sources of heterogeneity in types of new firms that might emerge in a local ecosystem and how they might develop over time as a result of MNEs’ entry, creating wealth. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature"

We refine previous barriers to absorptive capacity and classify them into internal (managerial biases and weak social integration mechanisms) and external (muted activation triggers, conflicting source relationships, and feeble appropriability regimes). We also identify how particular conditions in emerging markets (higher restraints on incentives, higher information asymmetries, and weaker contract protection) heighten the barriers. Using agency theory as the theoretical base, we provide a better understanding of absorptive capacity and of the influence of the home country on capability upgrading. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Building on the attention-based view, we investigate entrepreneurial management as an attentional driver to channel absorptive capacity towards corporate entrepreneurship. From the analysis of a sample of 298 supplier companies providing products and services to the mining industries in Australia and Iran, we observed that absorptive capacity fosters corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings also demonstrate that the dimensions of entrepreneurial management differentially affect the relationship between absorptive capacity and corporate entrepreneurship.

Our results showed that a firm’s homogeneous absorptive capacity has a positive effect on its short-term performance, while a firm’s heterogeneous absorptive capacity may hinder its short-term business performance. However, a high level of either homogeneous or heterogeneous absorptive capacity is not always useful to a firm’s long-term financial performance. Finally, cash, as a slack resource, was found to be more useful for the performance effect of heterogeneous absorptive capacity than for that of homogeneous absorptive capacity in the short term. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

To capture this bottom-up harvesting of local information embedded in host-markets, this study adopted the term ‘logalization’ from the economics literature and applied the absorptive capacity framework. Under the activation of absorptive capacity, host-market subsidiaries play a critical role in acquiring and assimilating relevant knowledge from the host market and disseminating it to headquarters. The home-country headquarters (HQ) then transforms relevant knowledge into an innovative standardized retail mix to exploit at the global level. The concept of ‘logalization’ differs from ‘glocalization’ found in the literature; glocalization incorporates the local context to establish a strategy at the local level, while logalization uses local information as a resource to develop a standardized strategy at the global level. The development of propositions is informed by semi-structured interviews with 10 managers employed by global retailers. By illustrating the logalization orientation, this research describes how global retailers can create an innovative retail mix by exploiting heterogeneous information from various host-markets to create and sustain a competitive advantage in the global market. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This article examines the factors that determine the channels through which clusters connect with global knowledge pipelines depending on the structure of the global value chain within which they are inserted, their knowledge base and their stage of evolution. Building on a comparative case study of the salmon farming cluster in Chile and the software cluster in Costa Rica, we adopt an evolutionary perspective based on historical analysis to better understand how the configuration of clusters’ international knowledge linkages shifts over time. Our findings suggest that (i) the more hierarchical the global value chain structure, the less room for knowledge co-creation between local and foreign actors; (ii) clusters relying on analytical knowledge bases opt for more formal and coordinated links with high involvement of public actors, whereas in clusters relying on synthetic knowledge bases, international knowledge interaction is based on less formal links mainly between business actors; and (iii) as clusters evolve the channels through which they connect with foreign knowledge increase in number and new ‘hybrid’ varieties develop. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Further, as women in leadership roles increase in firms, the relationship strengthens between export intensity and green innovations. The results also suggest that greater levels of absorptive capacity among firms strengthen the relationship between export intensity and green innovations.

Locating our study within manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, we find that absorptive capacity enhances the EO–performance relationship, both as a moderator and a mediator. In contrast to expectations, however, improvisation showed no such effects but conferred its own separate benefits instead. We further discuss the different effects of these learning modes on high performance and low performance groups. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC"

In order to estimate the productivity spillovers from FDI at the regional level, we select 10 industrial clusters across 4 regions in India. In estimating productivity, we control for a possible simultaneity bias by using semi-parametric estimation techniques. We find that local firms benefit from horizontal and vertical FDI, but the benefits from the latter are found to be substantially stronger. The absorptive capacity of domestic firms is highly relevant to harvest the spilled technology from foreign-owned firms. Furthermore, we find that domestic firms belonging to high-technology industries benefit more from FDI at the regional level. We also find that market concentration is a crucial conduit for firm innovation, technological upgradation, and having a direct effect on local firm total factor productivity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

In particular, we assess how individual learning goal orientation affects firm potential and realized absorptive capacity. Furthermore, we study how individuals' civic virtue acts as a micro-level social integration mechanism that moderates the effect from firm realized absorptive capacity to potential absorptive capacity. Using the multilevel structural equation modeling technique and data from 871 core-knowledge employees nested in 139 high-technology firms, we find support to our major hypotheses. Together, this study finds support for the micro-foundations' perspective and generates novel insights on how individual-level factors could be linked with firm-level heterogeneity in absorptive capacity. Managerial summary: We study how employees' characteristics contribute to a firm's absorptive capacity, that is, the ability of a firm to identify, assimilate, and exploit knowledge from the environment. Because firms have increasingly tapped into external resources to foster innovation over the past two decades, absorptive capacity is crucial to firm learning and success. Using data from 871 core-knowledge employees in 139 high-technology firms, we find that individual employees' learning goal orientation, the tendency to seek improvements in employees' competence and to understand or master new things advances the development of a firm's potential and realized absorptive capacity. More important, individual employees' civic virtue, the discretionary involvement in company issues, serves as a social integration mechanism that reduces the gap between firm potential and realized absorptive capacity.

Based on the analysis of four inbound open innovation projects at Fortum, a multinational energy utility company, we argue that companies with low R&D intensity may adopt an alternative approach which aims at substituting – not merely complementing – internal R&D with external innovations. We adopt the absorptive capacity perspective while investigating the cases and focus on four distinct capabilities: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. We find that the substitution approach consists of short-term research on new technological areas in order to gain the ability to identify and evaluate alternative technologies, as well as joint business models and operations based on complementary capabilities between the parties. The cases also suggest that the innovation process requires significant collaboration and the buying company's supplier management capabilities may improve the success of inbound open innovation projects of this type. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

However, extant literature has focused on AC as (1) a static and (2) a firm-centred concept. In particular, there is little conceptual framing and empirical evidence of how AC develops over time and across boundaries. Taking R&D consortia as the unit of analysis and based on insights from three in-depth case studies of collaborative R&D, our contribution is a framework for AC development over time and across inter-organizational, intra-organizational, and practice boundaries at different stages of collaboration in R&D consortia. Using this framework, we identify a set of mechanisms which enable the development of AC and we discuss the preconditions for these mechanisms. For R&D managers, our research implies that in order to enhance effectiveness of knowledge transfer and learning in R&D consortia they need to develop a strategy that (1) supports learning and AC development throughout the whole cycle of the collaboration, not only by focusing on intra-firm capabilities, but in particular by providing flexible interfaces for overcoming a variety of interaction and learning boundaries between heterogeneous R&D partners, and (2) enables the integration of created and acquired knowledge within the organization once the collaboration is over. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The study provides a nuanced and contextualized understanding of servitization in M&As. Existing research on servitization has paid insufficient attention to collaborative partnerships. There is a need to examine the role of servitization in the context of collaborative partnerships. Our empirical setting consists of Chinese manufacturing firms' acquisitions in Germany. Using qualitative research methods, we reveal a typology of servitization strategies - adding, utilizing, and reconfiguring – that underpin the combined influences of different levels of services of both acquirer and target firms in the M&A. We identify integration mode and absorptive capacity as factors influencing service capability development. Our findings contribute to the literature on alternative approaches to servitization by firms from emerging markets venturing into advanced economies.

Aiming to investigate the roles of information technology (IT) in facilitating innovation through boundary spanning, we collected data from the pharmaceutical industry over a six-year period to test the research model.

In this paper, we conceptualize firms’ approach to certification and link the approaches to various aspects of certification. Using an inductive approach and deriving our data from multiple case studies from forestry FSC certification, we argue that firms’ approach to certification is explained by their development of absorptive capacity, alignment of their organizational routines and their engagement in negotiations with FSC. We also argue that these approaches affect firm’s benefits from certification, their level of adherence to the requirements of the certification and their likelihood to withdraw from the certification.

We find that, although scaling up public investment could provide a boost to growth, too rapid fiscal outlays will push the economy to its limit of absorptive capacity and increase macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Prudent fiscal policy, particularly moderating infrastructure investment and optimizing investment efficiency, is essential to maintain economic stability, as well as to boost the long-term sustainable growth for developing countries like Mongolia. © 2017 The Authors"
"“Keep open”: the potential of gatekeepers for the aligning universities to the new Knowledge Triangle","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961911071&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2016.03.012&partnerID=40&md5=4e4f17097381faab66360878cbe72b3e","Universities are increasingly seen as institutions which anticipate and address the challenges induced by interactions within the Knowledge Triangle (KT). The interactions between actors in the KT force individual agents to adjust and refine their models of operation and provide targeted output which supports the activities of other agents. Among companies, we saw the emergence of the open innovation concept which stresses the will of companies to cooperate in innovation. At the same time, the scientific community is increasingly challenged by open access to research findings and by online learning courses. These two recent developments are among the most important that were significantly initiated by gatekeepers, themselves especially important actors within the KT because they possess the power to orchestrate and direct the linkages between KT actors. Until recently, the role of gatekeepers within the KT has been little analysed. The paper suggests that understanding the role and characteristics of gatekeepers is essential for substantial and sustainable interactions between KT agents and the fulfilment of the Third Mission of universities. Therefore, the linkages go beyond purely knowledge and technology transfer linkages but rather show how gatekeepers influence competency-building for delivering information and technologies to other organizations and enhancing institutions' absorptive capacity which is argued to be crucial for implementing effective, targeted, and productive interactions of universities. It is argued that universities need to be aware of gatekeepers' competences and powers well in advance to make use of knowledge exchange with other parties to shape society. In addition, it is argued that universities' skill base – as shown in researchers' competences – is a vital element of universities' intellectual capital which should be included in universities' performance evaluation frameworks. Finally, the paper argues that it is important for policy making in science, technology and innovation to possess knowledge of gatekeepers' position in the KT to enhance collaboration between KT agents and provide research institutions, namely universities, with the competences needed to vitalize the universities' ‘Third Mission’. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

This article focuses on how new ventures can design a business model bottom up while simultaneously adapting to and shaping the context in which the venture is operating. Through a single case study of a globally leading mini-utility firm in the rural electricity sector at the BoP, this article makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on business model design by showing that specifically designed interim business models facilitate adaptation to and the shaping of the context. Second, the article refines the native capability construct, splitting it into native “pull” and “push” capabilities. This brings nuance to much of the BoP literature that suggests ventures yield to local context. Third, the article links the business model design and native pull/push capability to potential and realized absorptive capacity. Accordingly, hands-on strategies for developing potential and realized absorptive capacity are suggested. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The results of the survey data from 402 firms reveal that the efficacy of firm innovativeness is not universal but simultaneously contingent on absorptive capacity and market turbulence. Furthermore, absorptive capacity does not always enhance the value of firm innovativeness; the positive moderating effect of absorptive capacity manifests itself only when market turbulence is relatively high. These findings also highlight that change in customer needs is a key factor affecting the complementarity of relevant resources and capabilities. Thus, this study contributes to advances in theory and has new practical implications. Copyright © 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2015 ASAC.

We identify the challenges involved, the barriers to technological change, and the difficulties of transferring knowledge related to absorptive capacity. We conduct an in depth case study of a joint venture created by Freyssinet and Azaran to build a new roof to the Mashhad stadium. We conducted 41 interviews over a 19 month period. Our findings indicate that radical innovation is characterized by safety, quality, and planning challenges which engender delays, non-conformity to specifications, and additional costs. Freyssinet was unsuccessful in transferring explicit and tacit knowledge because Azaran suffered from poor organizational absorptive capacity. Its high absorptive capacity allowed Freyssinet to adapt its operations to Azaran's tacit knowledge routines. Our research is meaningful to the construction sector, an economically and socially significant sector in Iran that faces serious issues. Our study has practical implications for Iranian firms and for foreign firms operating in Iran. We contribute to strengthen the understanding of Iranian technology development by focusing on radical innovation standards, joint venture specific learning dyads, and complex knowledge transfer. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

The findings of this study challenge the conventional idea that international collaboration, especially collaboration with developed countries that possess frontier knowledge, better promotes innovation in developing countries. For the period from 1999 to 2004, only in first-tier regions of China do domestic and international university collaborations show a positive relation with local corporate innovation. In the period from 2005 to 2012, the positive spillover effect of both types of collaboration spreads to second-tier regions. However, international collaboration is negatively associated with firms’ innovation in the least developed regions. Furthermore, domestic collaboration has shown a larger positive impact on corporate innovation than international collaboration in recent years. In our paper, the regional absorptive capacity was identified to explain this puzzle. We argue that the universities of relatively developed regions should build research collaborations with both local and global universities to promote local innovation. Conversely, for underdeveloped regions, universities should emphasize local technological demand rather than blindly pursue international collaboration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Integrating the literatures on absorptive capacity and social interaction, the analysis of survey data from 273 Chinese manufacturing firms suggests that employees' informal interactions are positively associated with knowledge acquisition and enhance firms' innovation capabilities.

Through empirically testing the phenomenon in the Korean context, we reveal that market knowledge absorption by subsidiaries is a critical component that influences the knowledge integration mechanisms (KIMs) within MNC networks. Furthermore, KIMs within MNC networks are primary keys for absorptive capacity (AC) of HQs and knowledge relevance between HQs and subsidiaries.

Although previous studies indicated that governance directly influences performance, and that learning directly influences performance, there is little deductive evidence exploring the relationship between all three variables, especially at a high level of disaggregation. A conceptual model is developed based on the literature, which defines collaborative learning capability (CLC) as an absorptive capacity that construction organizations develop to explore, transform, and exploit knowledge through 18 specific learning routines. These routines influence formal and informal governance types and, ultimately, three different performance metrics for projects. This study is based on a survey of 320 experienced practitioners on Australian collaborative infrastructure projects in the construction sector. Statistical tests demonstrated that the CLC measurement scale developed by the authors is reliable and valid. CLC in this context is found to be based on 18 confirmed individual learning routines, organized into six learning factors and three learning phases. The study confirmed CLC influences PP through project GS. However, the usage intensity of individual learning routines was found to be lacking on Australian collaborative infrastructure projects. The specific and important role of CLC in PP has been highlighted for the first time, but construction organizations need to invest more heavily in their CLC through stronger mobilization of individual routines. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Having an OS that is compatible with Iranian security applications and requirements is imperative. The first attempt to create local operating system in Iran was made some 10 years ago, when pertinent technological research led to the development of Xamin as Iran's localized operating system. When the first version of the Xamin localized operating system was introduced in the market, some 250 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as 5 large organizations adopted the national operating system. This study analyzes the process of acceptance of Xamin localized open source server operating system technology in Iran. A technology acceptance model (TAM) has been used as the base model, and external variables have been determined based on surveying method. Moreover, two moderator variables have been introduced as new contributors in this study. The results are extracted using path analysis based on structural equation modeling. The statistical population is 250 Xamin users. Data collection tools consist of 200 questionnaires filled out by these users. The results show that subjective norm component and absorptive capacity moderator are two factors affecting the acceptance of this technology. Eventually, given Iran's special conditions, recommendations have been provided for strategic planning or policymaking for acceptance of Xamin operating system.

By drawing on fieldwork and empirical evidence from Iran's oil and gas industry, a multiple-case study has been conducted. It is found that the institutional regime of this sector jeopardizes technological learning scenarios through 4 overarching aspects: Cost, Time, Risk and Management structure, which we call “the CTRM square”. It is also revealed that the locked-in institutional structure of the sector creates a “negative co-evolution” among actors leading to impairment of technological learning. Our data shows that the characteristics of large socio-technical regimes in developing countries act in favour of such impairment. These regimes create strong commitment in stakeholder groups. Such commitment establishes dominancy around technological routines, which is the result of low absorptive capacity of stakeholders and their lack of awareness regarding new technological scenarios. In some cases, political conditions surrounding a project as well as personal gains lead to the stakeholder's deliberate action against a new technological scenario. The negative co-evolution contributes to the supply side change of strategy in order to safeguard their market position which ultimately engenders dominancy of obsolete technological routines in the firms diminishing technological learning in the oil and gas industry. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Thus, many service firms strive to achieve not only efficiency in service delivery, but also creativity in decisions or problem-solving with an aim to maintaining competitiveness in today's dynamic environments. However, the discipline of operations management has traditionally focused on improving efficiency in operational activities, while offering very limited insights regarding practices that can improve operational efficiency as well as employee creativity. Grounded in social cognitive theory, we identify three operational improvement practices in this paper, namely continuous improvement, structured methods, and psychological safety, which are pertinent to learning experiences and behaviours (i.e., major elements in developing individuals’ creativity), can help service firms achieve both operational efficiency and employee creativity. We also adopt a multi-level analysis to study whether two relevant learning capabilities, namely potential absorptive capacity and ambidexterity, can enhance the effectiveness of the three identified operational improvement practices. We test our hypotheses by using survey data collected from 146 frontline teams in China's banking industry. We contribute to research on service operations management by offering new insights linking operational improvement practices and employee creativity. Service firms that value the importance of both operational efficiency and creative solutions should find our results particularly useful because our results provide precise guidelines on improving both operational performance and employee creativity through the adoption of relevant operational improvement practices and learning capabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

This work adopts the context theorizing approach that informs the conceptualization of KMS use and identification of contingency factors. Specifically, the literature on rich system use is adapted to develop the construct in the context of a KMS. The literature related to task, system, user, and leadership is also drawn upon to identify four contingency factors - task nonroutineness, perceived support for contextualization, absorptive capacity, and transformational leadership - that affect the KMS use and job performance relationship. The paper argues that rich use of a KMS positively affects job performance and the four contingency factors moderate this relationship. A mixed methods approach that includes a quantitative study (n = 1,441) among knowledge workers in seven business units of a large organization in the finance industry was used to validate the theoretical model. A follow-up qualitative study (n = 48) was conducted in one business unit to cross-validate the findings and explain unsupported findings. Data were collected from multiple sources (i.e., surveys, interviews, and system archives). The results largely supported the model.

The entrepreneur knowledge provides a basis for continued growth in value of the resource bundle and leveraging one resource to achieve another. Iran as a country under economic sanctions confronts restricting international communication, increasing investment risks, reducing technological imports, and paralyzing bank systems which conclude to resource constraint while the Iranian technology ventures are developing simultaneously. However, little is yet known about how the technology ventures configure resources under the sanction. Drawing upon the resource-based view (RBV) and absorptive capacity of the firm, this study explains how the interplay between firm's resources affects performance. We tested our model using survey data from Iranian technology firms. Results from PLS-SEM analyses demonstrate a unique effect of the sanction and resource limitation to the resource configuration of firms, in that the impact of entrepreneurs' knowledge, social and political network on firm performance is strongest when financial resources are either low or high. In this research, we strive to understand the required vital resources for developing new ventures in Iran and also aim to decipher how one bundle of resource can be leveraged to acquire another. Moreover, individual resources can overcome the liability of newness and impact technology firm performance through development of organizational resources and financial resources.

The results reveal that, for a given level of foreign presence, it pays to increase the absorptive capacity of firms operating in lower quantiles. When it comes to inter-industry spillovers, it is counterproductive to increase the absorptive capacity of firms already operating in higher quantiles, as this diverts resources from other productive activities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis."

The Innovplus programme was designed and implemented in Northern Ireland to help nascent high technology companies become more competitive and to contribute to the goals of the Regional Innovation Strategy. A knowledge-based absorptive capacity framework is used as the theoretical lens to explore the relationships between policy interpretation and programme design and the development of innovation capability within participant SMEs. The findings show that the design of the Innovplus programme, while linked to a coherent Regional Innovation Strategy, lacks consistency in relation to the policy and practical interpretation of knowledge and innovation. This inconsistency is reflected in the practical design of the programme, limiting its effectiveness as a result.

The process of transferring knowledge is an ongoing progression of learning, adjusting, and improving. At the organizational level, knowledge transfer manifests itself through changes in the knowledge of a unit. Most successful knowledge transfer efforts actively involve both the source of the knowledge and its receiver. Establishing performance expectations for those who will use the knowledge further quantifies the value of the transfer. Companies considering or using knowledge transfer processes, should continuously evaluate their social media readiness. The benefits of knowledge transfer for workplaces include the increases in productivity, speed, agility, profits, and growth. © 2018, IGI Global. All rights reserved."

We focus on how the positioning of MNEs in their domestic network of strategic alliances affects their geographic scope, i.e., whether they concentrate on their home region or expand beyond it. We theorize that embeddedness in alliance networks constitutes a double-edged sword to the geographic scope of MNEs. Strong embeddedness in domestic alliance networks drives the development of location-bound firm-specific advantages (FSAs), which may narrow down MNEs’ geographic scope. In contrast, moderate embeddedness leads to more non-location-bound FSAs, which reduce liability of foreignness, and hence motivate MNEs to widen their geographical scope. We thus predict a non-linear relationship between domestic alliance network embeddedness and MNE geographic scope. Furthermore, the impact of the domestic alliance network on MNE geographic scope hinges on the organizational ability to efficiently and effectively absorb resources stemming from the network. We test our hypotheses using FDI data from 302 US MNEs in the information and communication technology industry for the period of 2001–2008, and generally find robust support for the hypothesized relationships. © 2017 Academy of International Business"

Methodology/approach: Using a quantitative approach, the authors analyze data from 141 Israeli business-to-business high-tech firms. Findings: The data mostly supported the hypotheses. Empirical findings imply that an uncertain environment is a precursor for a strong effort to develop a technological absorptive capacity and, to a lesser extent, a marketing absorptive capacity. Technological and marketing absorptive capacities were found to be distinct constructs with positive impacts on financial and innovation performance. Marketing absorptive capacity had a stronger impact than technological absorptive capacity on financial performance. Surprisingly, marketing absorptive capacity was negatively associated with innovation performance. Originality/value: This study attempts to overcome some limiting assumptions of absorptive capacity theory that have contributed to its reification in order to make three theoretical contributions. First, it distinguishes between marketing and technological absorptive capacities. Second, it tests differential responses of the two absorptive capacities to environmental contingencies. Third, it compares the differential impacts of marketing and technological absorptive capacities on financial and innovation performance. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This is based on observation that the absorptive capacity of the SCI is relatively low, which leads to lower competitiveness. Around 21 (twenty one) SCI in Gianyar, Bali Province, change their business into other businesses due to being unable to compete in the crafts industry and their absorptive capacity to assimilate and apply new values and new technologies is considered low. This research aims to (1) develop the proposition concept of the influence of creative leadership towards absorptive capacity; (2) attest to the influence of the knowledge-sharing on the absorptive capacity; (3) attest to the influence of creative leadership towards knowledge sharing, and; (4) develop the concept of mediating role of knowledge sharing over the influence of creative leadership against absorptive capacity. The study was done in Gianyar Regency, with a sample of 90 Small Industry Craftsmen (SCI) in 7 (seven) subdistricts. The analysis tool used was the Partial Least Square (PLS). This research identified that the proposition which states that creative leadership influences absorptive capacity is proven positive and significant. Knowledge sharing gives a positive and significant effect on the absorptive capacity. Creative leadership significantly and positively affects knowledge sharing; furthermore, knowledge sharing has been found having partial mediating role over the influence of creative leadership on absorptive capacity."

The firms' ability to acquire new knowledge depends on strong search practices and the corresponding absorptive capacity where the latter predefine firms' ability to span out of its core competences area, to follow the open innovation processes. Absorptive capacity is often seen as a precondition for the open innovation success. This research focuses on the cases of open innovation when the absorptive capacity is absent internally and is taken in charge by an open innovation intermediary that is capable to develop the potential absorptive capacity for the firm. Based on an exploratory case study of an intermediary platform that proposes novelty driven search practices – ideXlab, our results demonstrate how intermediary can accelerate the absorptive capacity value recognition function and therefore, potentially facilitate further diffusion of knowledge.

Both market and technical knowledge appeared to be important for spin-offs, and these were available from both customers and the parent research center. The findings' main implication is spin-offs need a blending capability to balance between (1) market and technical knowledge, (2) market-pull and technology-push approaches, (3) the involvement of customers and parent research centers, and (4) potential and realized absorptive capacities.

The social and cooperative agrifood arrangement has become one of the main and newest types of nonprofit organization in China since the implementation of the law related to specialized cooperatives, on July 1, 2007. In this research, a conceptual model is proposed to show that the characteristics of innovative sources can determine a firm's absorptive capacity, which in turn can impact its performance. Therefore, absorptive capacity can be expected to enable the mediation of the relationships of innovative sources with the performance of firms. By means of theoretical analysis and practical investigation, this paper provides an assessment of the use of innovation sources and finds critical factors that may foster competitive and sustainable advantages.

We distinguish between corporate ventures (CVs) and ventures created by independent entrepreneurs (IVs) and explore the extent to which they vary in: (1) the emphasis on building different absorptive capacity dimensions and (2) their performance gains from absorptive capacity dimensions. Using data from 140 new ventures, our results show that CVs emphasize potential absorptive capacity (combining external knowledge acquisition and assimilation) more than IVs. Conversely, IVs focus more on exploiting external knowledge. We also find that efforts in activating realized absorptive capacity (combining external knowledge transformation and exploitation) have a negative effect on the performance of new ventures that is stronger for CVs than IVs. Yet, this negative effect of realized absorptive capacity on new venture performance is mitigated when combined with efforts in potential absorptive capacity in the case of CVs.

More specifically, this work proposes and empirically tests how potential absorptive capacity is related with the identification of opportunities in new technology-based firms (NTBFs). To take into account the unique nature of NTBFs we divide potential absorptive capacity into problem absorptive capacity, i.e. the ability to identify and acquire knowledge of the goals, aspirations and needs of current and potential customers, and solution absorptive capacity, i.e. the ability to identify and acquire external knowledge of solutions to fulfill them. We develop three hypotheses, which predict that both problem absorptive capacity and solution absorptive capacity will be positively related with the identification of opportunities in NTBFs and that they will reinforce each other. The findings support the importance of making a distinction between the two proposed dimensions of potential absorptive capacity and shed light on their effectiveness and interaction for the identification of opportunities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Over the past 10 years, many organisations have systematically adopted social media. Trade press and consulting companies often claim that the systematic use of social media increases the performance of organisations. However, such claims are typically neither empirically grounded nor theoretically examined. In this paper, based on key informant interviews at 20 organisations, we examine these claims empirically and theoretically. Firstly, we examine the ways in which social media are used by organisations. We identify five different social media use types that support different organisational purposes (broadcast, dialogue, collaboration, knowledge management and sociability). Secondly, we analyse how these five social media use types relate to organisations' absorptive capacity. We find that particular social media use types (e.g., dialogue) support organisations' absorptive capacity and, ultimately, their performance although others (e.g., sociability) do not. © 2016 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved."

Extant research does not explicitly address whether individuals should better specialize in certain absorption efforts or rather work as generalists dedicated to a range of efforts. We suggest that assimilation efforts increase the value of individuals’ efforts at external search and at promoting the utilization of external knowledge, which culminates in two main absorption roles that can help individuals achieve greater innovation performance. We argue that gatekeepers who combine external search with assimilation effort help to achieve innovation by contributing to building potential absorptive capacity, while shepherds who combine assimilation with utilization effort aid innovation by building realized absorptive capacity. We find support for these predictions and discuss the implications for research and managerial practice in open innovation. © 2017 The Author(s)"

First, foresight activities would benefit from being more informed by the convergence literature and global convergence experience over the past several decades, and should therefore incorporate organically the concepts of absorptive capacity and technology gap into foresight exercises. Second, certain preconditions – in particular the existence of a functional national innovation system – enhance the likelihood that foresight exercises will be successful. Third, in order to achieve wide buy-in and promote the sustainability of initiatives generated by the foresight activity, developing countries are advised to consult widely in the foresight process.

Our explorative research, which is based on interviews with HR managers and FFGs, offers three major findings related to international HR development methods. Firstly, the inpatriate literature has identified the roles of foreign (subsidiary) staff as knowledge conduits and boundary-spanners between headquarters and subsidiaries. While such objectives do not drive Japan’s FFG hiring trend, we find similar challenges in terms of the absorptive capacities of headquarters. Secondly, following a Varieties-of-Capitalism perspective, we argue that FFG hiring is an institutional answer to the particularities of Japan’s employment system. Aiming at internationalizing headquarters from within, it contributes to resolving the internationalization conundrum of Japanese MNEs, but rather than overcoming the existing ethnocentric HR model it accommodates this orientation. Thirdly, we advance the general HR literature by proposing a new framework that addresses the viability of international personnel development methods in dependence of the workforce diversity and distinctiveness of employment practices in headquarters.

The purpose of this study is to explore the antecedents and outcomes of the breadth and depth of absorptive capacity from the perspective of social capital theory. Based on a sample of 218 Chinese firms, empirical results suggest that weak tie sources and knowledge breadth can enhance the breadth of absorptive capacity, and that strong tie sources and knowledge depth can strengthen the depth of absorptive capacity. The results also suggest that the breadth of absorptive capacity positively impacts the depth of absorptive capacity, and that both breadth and depth of absorptive capacity are positively related to innovation performance.

To address this gap, this study conceptualizes multidimensional components of absorptive capacity and develops a nomological network that explicates relationships between these components and competitive advantage in product innovation. By marrying the open innovation and absorptive capacity perspectives, higher-order models of absorptive capacity are proposed which delineate the underlying processes to recognize, assimilate, and exploit external sources of innovation. The empirical analysis of the nomological network based on original survey data reveals important findings. First, there is a positive indirect baseline association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation, mediated by the firm's technology-related capabilities. Second, components of absorptive capacity modify this indirect baseline relationship. Recognition capacity is positively associated with external technological resource access and therefore, operates as an antecedent to the proposed baseline relationship. Assimilation capacity constitutes a relevant condition to the proposed baseline relationship. The indirect association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation is dependent on the level of assimilation capacity. Exploitation capacity has an additional and independent direct positive association with competitive advantage in product innovation. This study contributes to the open innovation literature by delineating organizational processes that help to explain interfirm differences in benefiting from external sources of innovation. In addition, this study adds to the absorptive capacity literature by developing and validating a set of measures that captures, individually and in concert, three components of absorptive capacity. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association"

"The Paradox of Openness: How Product and Patenting Experience Affect R&D Sourcing in China?","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997343273&doi=10.1111%2fjpim.12359&partnerID=40&md5=c34e6641fe1b7074ce9ac6580b7d6068","External R&D sourcing may help firms compete in an environment characterized by rapid technological changes. Yet, prior studies have produced conflicting findings on how a firm's technological experience affects the extent to which the firm engages in external R&D sourcing. Although many highlight that firms with extensive technological experience are equipped with more technological knowledge, collaborative skills, and absorptive capacity, encouraging greater levels of external R&D, others suggest the opposite due to potential exchange hazards and partnership conflicts. Adopting an external partner's perspective, the current study reconsiders this “paradox of openness” by analyzing how a focal firm's product experience and patenting experience affect an external partner's tendency to provide external R&D services to the focal firm. Specifically, this study explore how a focal firm's knowledge protectiveness and tacitness embedded in its product and patenting experience influences the external partners' motivation for knowledge transfer. This study predicts that a firm's product experience increases the focal firm's external R&D sourcing because it provides high levels of knowledge tacitness and external openness and can encourage external partners to share and exchange knowledge with the focal firm. In contrast, a firm's patenting experience decreases the focal firm's external R&D sourcing because it denotes knowledge explicitness and protectiveness and may discourage external partners to share and exchange knowledge with the focal firm. This study further predicts that patenting experience has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between product experience and external R&D sourcing. Using a data set of 575 high-tech firms in China, this study finds support for our predictions. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the knowledge-based view and technology entrepreneurship in emerging markets. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association"

The focus is on decisions made in R&D-active small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of absorptive capacity, open innovation, type of R&D, and the organizational structuring of R&D. Based on a representative set of R&D-active firms in Belgium, qualitative comparative analysis reveals that the outcomes in terms of financial performance related to optimal configurations of strategic R&D decisions depend on the firm's size and on the time-lag under consideration. Managers in small-sized firms are advised to pay particular attention to a more functionally-structured R&D approach in configurations of strategic R&D decisions. To increase medium-term financial performance, managers in medium-sized firms benefit from more engagement in research-oriented activities, more in-house innovation, and the enhancement of absorptive capacity in sets of strategic R&D decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

With subsidized R&D cooperation agreements both agents partially achieve their objectives. For this reason, in Europe, policymakers grant subsidies for R&D activities with the condition of establishing R&D cooperation agreements. This study explores the relationship of complementarity between R&D subsidy, R&D cooperation and absorptive capacity in the context of its contribution to labor productivity of enterprises. The data used comes from the Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC), managed by the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We selected manufacturing companies in the period 2008–2013. We evaluate the existence of complementarity through the systems approach and the interaction approach. The econometric technique that we used to estimate the coefficients of our empirical model was maximum-likelihood random effects. As a consequence of the low absorptive capacity of Spanish manufacturing firms we find that R&D subsidies and R&D cooperation agreements are not complementary variables, i.e., receiving public subsidies as a result of establishing R&D cooperation agreements has a lower impact on productivity than the sum of the individual impacts of R&D cooperation and R&D subsidies. In consequence, this result calls into question the convenience of using subsidized R&D cooperation agreements as a tool for promoting innovation in EU countries as there are notable differences between the companies in these countries in terms of absorption capacity. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York"

We point out that the relevance of the digital eco-system focusing on the role of social networking sites in relationship to innovation and knowledge. The use of social networking sites can provide a wealth of information about individuals and their networks, which can be utilised for various business purposes. It enables enterprises to create online communities and share user-created content. Within this context, enterprises actively interact with external actors such as customers, public institutions, and other businesses to acquire and absorb external knowledge, and then generate innovation. To gain insights from the global economy, 215 small to medium enterprises from different sets of global enterprises, both knowledge-intensive (e.g. management consulting, marketing and advertising, ICT and related services, legal and technical services) and labour-intensive (such as high tech and electronics, food and beverage, and consumer durables), were analysed. Via the Partial Least Square-Path Modelling the relationships between social networking sites, absorptive capacity, and innovation performance were measured. Therefore, recommendations are proffered as to what small-medium enterprises should do in order to enhance their innovativeness.

Capacity for change implementation is a critical success factor as the health care industry is faced with ongoing demands for change and transformation because of technological advances, market forces, and regulatory environment. Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a tool to measure health care organizations' capacity to change by building upon previous conceptualizations of absorptive capacity and organizational readiness for change. Methodology/Approach: A multistep process was used to develop the organizational capacity for change survey. The survey was sent to two populations requesting answers to questions about the organization's leadership, culture, and technologies in use throughout the organization. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to validate the survey as a measurement tool for organizational capacity for change in the health care setting. Findings: The resulting organizational capacity for change measurement tool proves to be a valid and reliable method of evaluating a hospital's capacity for change through the measurement of the population's perceptions related to leadership, culture, and organizational technologies. Practical Implications: The organizational capacity for change measurement tool can help health care managers and leaders evaluate the capacity of employees, departments, and teams for change before large-scale implementation. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We considered two fixed effects econometric models; one for medical and the other for surgical specialties respectively. Our results show that increases in the quantity of research produced in medical (surgical) disciplines contribute significantly to the reduction of hospital LOS in medical (surgical) specialties. This effect is greater for hospitals with higher absorptive capacity (high R&D investment and with teaching status). There is also clear evidence that basic research produces efficiency gains in clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we have identified other important determinants of hospitals’ efficiency namely, hospitals’ characteristics, human resources, diagnostic activity, hospital investment and hospitals’ absorptive capacity.

In particular, we examine three research questions that address: (i) the interrelationships among the three dimensions of buyer–supplier social capital (structural, cognitive, relational); (ii) the mechanism through which buyer–supplier social capital can influence supplier performance; and (iii) the contingency factors that influence the key relationships in the main model. We empirically validate the research model using data collected from a North America-based major electronic components distributor (i.e., the buyer) and 166 of its suppliers. The findings of our data analysis indicate that structural and cognitive social capital influence relational social capital. The findings also support that relational social capital allows for the transfer of knowledge from the buyer to the supplier, which in turn leads to greater supplier cost efficiency and innovation. However, the influence of buyer–supplier relational social capital appears to be less important in lengthier buyer–supplier relationships. The analysis also indicates that the benefits derived from a supplier's knowledge enrichment are significantly greater when the supplier possesses greater exploitative capacity.

The motivation for the research emerged from the realisation that the majority of studies on university-industry innovation collaboration on organisational level present limited verification of why some seemingly similar collaboration projects fail while others thrive. Therefore, we aimed for reconceptualization of the way university-industry collaboration is analysed by developing the respective approach that was empirically tested via multiple case-study research of 12 cases. The approach combines elements of the U-I collaboration literature with a model of interaction from semiotics and boundary-crossing ideas from organisation theory. The novelty of this approach lies in explaining the heterogeneity and variation of U-I collaboration on individual level. The interaction model from the semiotics enables distinct U-I collaboration patterns to emerge. In a two-dimensional model it becomes clear that choosing the appropriate partner for potentially successful collaboration means matching the levels of preconditions between partners. The main contribution of this study is twofold: an interdisciplinary approach for analysing U-I collaboration using a multiple case-study research design and the explanation of relevant preconditions – individual rather than institutional levels of motivation and absorptive capacity – as critical aspects that determine the likelihood of the success or failure of such collaboration. © 2017"

By using Suning as a case study, we explore how a large retailer combines its online and offline units. The process model demonstrates that an online–offline hybrid organization is hybridized through three multiple and conflicting boundary permeability paths, namely complete, partial, and preventive permeability paths. Each path includes a capacity-seeking process in which the organization improves its capabilities after developing strategies. Corresponding to the three paths, the organization develops absorptive, symbiotic, and preservative strategies. It then enhances its capabilities accordingly, including its assimilative, ambidextrous, and autonomous capabilities, to implement the necessary boundary permeability behaviors and form a hybrid organization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Acquisition literature has focused only on the levels of innovation or relational resources, the primary dimensions of organizational resource bases. The authors argue that in addition to the levels, the degree of overlap between the acquiring and target firms, in terms of innovation and relational resources, should influence acquisitions. Furthermore, they argue for the importance of the quality of the target's resources along with factors influencing the acquirer's absorptive capacity (e.g., the chief executive officer's [CEO's] functional background and the acquiring firm's marketing intensity and acquisition experience) as contingencies. Using 319 biopharmaceutical acquisitions and a random-effect regression model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of relational and innovation overlap, the authors find that innovation overlap has a positive effect, whereas relational overlap has a negative effect, on acquisition outcomes.

A theoretical model that includes the effects of technological gaps and absorptive capacity, both presenting nonlinear relationships is proposed. A sample of 2722 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1993 to 2006 was used. Threshold regression made it possible to contrast the non-linear relationship between inward FDI and productivity improvement in domestic firms, which is conditioned by the absorptive capacity and geographical distance. Spanish domestic firms with high absorptive capacities benefit from positive spillovers and have sufficient capability to internalize the more complex knowledge provided by multinational firms. The rest of the firms are negatively affected by the presence of multinational firms. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

A 35 -year period (1979-2013), which is covered by this paper, witnessed gradual introduction of economic reforms picking up speed from early 1990s. The doors were opened to FDI. Undertaking an empirical study on FDI’s contribution to growth of Indian economy by taking into account the role of financial sector development (FSD) as a contingent factor, this paper concludes that FDI and FSD have contributed to growth. It is also confirmed that the interaction term between FDI and financial development indicates a complementary relationship between the two. © 2017, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved."

This study theorizes that effective processing and management of customer information flows requires organizations to possess ""relational information processing capability"" (RIPC) and ""analytical information processing capability"" (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC)."

At the same time, innovation literature has shown that accessing and integrating knowledge from sources that reside outside the firm, such as customers, competitors, universities, or consultants, is critical to firms' innovative success. In this paper, we draw on the knowledge-based view of the firm to investigate how search in external knowledge sources and information technology for knowledge absorption jointly influence process innovation performance. Our model is tested on a nine-year panel (2003-2011) of Swiss firms from a wide range of manufacturing industries. Using instrumental variables, and disaggregating by type of IT, we find that data access systems and network connectivity hold very different potential for the effective absorption of external knowledge, and the subsequent realized economic gains from process innovation. Against the backdrop of today's digital transformation, our findings demonstrate how firms should coordinate strategies for sourcing external knowledge with specific IT investments in order to improve their innovation performance."

In this paper, we hypothesize that two language-oriented HRM practices – language-sensitive recruitment and language training – enhance absorptive capacity in foreign subsidiaries.

However, a firm can only benefit from individual efforts if it understands to what extent the dimensions of individual-level absorptive capacity are related to its innovation strategy. A firm's innovation strategy is characterized by the notions of exploration and exploitation, which result in either radical or incremental innovation. This study examines the driving factors of individual-level absorptive capacity regarding a firm's exploration versus exploitation strategy. Using quantitative data from 104 individuals, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was conducted, verifying individuals' competencies in identifying external knowledge as a trigger for both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Consequently, these specific abilities also contribute to organizational ambidexterity. Furthermore, the results show the dichotomous contribution of individual competencies in assimilating external knowledge. While exploratory innovation thrives with individual assimilation efforts, realization of exploitative innovation is not significantly related to these efforts. Ultimately, individuals' competencies in utilizing external knowledge are significantly related to neither exploratory nor exploitative innovation. Moreover, this study provides means for managers to systematically position individuals in the external search process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

This article builds on the phenomenon of big data and offers an integrative conceptual framework that captures not only the benefits but also the costs of big data for managing the frontline employee (FLE)-customer interaction. Along the positive path, the framework explains how the “3Vs” of big data (volume, velocity, and variety) have the potential to improve service quality and reduce service costs by influencing big data value and organizational change at the firm and FLE levels. However, the 3Vs of big data also increase big data veracity, which casts doubt about the value of big data. The authors further propose that because of heterogeneity in big data absorptive capacities at the firm level, the costs of adopting big data in FLE management may outweigh the benefits. Finally, while FLEs can benefit from big data, extracting knowledge from such data does not discount knowledge derived from FLEs’ small data. Rather, combining and integrating the firm’s big data with FLEs’ small data are crucial to absorbing and applying big data knowledge.

For any given period, ABC is defined as the natural logarithm of a firm’s total factor productivity (TFP) in the previous period relative to the firm’s initial TFP. An alternative measure of ABC considers real value added per worker in lieu of TFP. Overall, we find that firms with high levels of ABC derive productivity gains from the contemporaneous and prior use of imported intermediates, particularly for firms operating in the input-intensive industries.

Empirical test using China's manufacturing firms finds positive productivity spillovers between foreign suppliers and their domestic customers. However, there is no positive spillovers from foreign-owned customers or competitors. Domestic firms’ in-house R&D capital facilitates learning from foreign firms.

Further, relevant studies have indicated that absorptive capacity is closely related to the degree of benefit SMEs can get from non-R&D-based innovation. Non-R&D-based innovation provides newly innovative ideas for the enterprise, while absorptive capacity helps enterprises to adapt to the diverse actual situations, which further improves the innovation performance. Therefore, this paper is trying to reveal the pervasive non-R&D-based innovation practices in Chinese SMEs basing on a case study of Fashion in China (FC in short). It shows that non-R&D-based innovation activities, namely technology adoption, imitation and reverse engineering, design, innovative implication of existing knowledge, etc., have positive effects on innovative performance, and the enterprise's absorptive capacity also has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between non-R&D-based innovation activities and innovation performance.

To verify the research hypotheses, the survey responses from 138 R&D employees of a multinational electronics company are analysed through structural equation modelling. The results show that both sub-dimensions of absorptive capacity directly influence innovative behaviour. However, knowledge sharing’s effect on innovative behaviour is indirect through realised absorptive capacity.

Agility has often been compared with absorptive capacity, another dynamic capability. However, these comparisons lack depth. We compare and contrast agility with absorptive capacity. For this, we trace back the evolution of the two concepts which leads us to the emergence of convergence between the two. We then compare the two at construct level. We show how the sensing and responding components of agility are similar to potential and realised absorptive capacity components of Absorptive capacity. Through a review of alignment literature, we propose that agility could be a special case of absorptive capacity where potential and realised absorptive capacities are aligned for superior firm performance in dynamic environment.

To test this hypothesis, we introduce a new approach to measuring regional absorptive capacity and, via exploratory factor analysis, identifies two types of absorptive capacity: cognitive capacity and technical capacity. Multivariate analysis finds a significant moderating role of cognitive capacity (and to a lesser extent technical capacity) in the impact of knowledge on regional economic performance and therefore supports absorptive capacity as an effective mechanism for the penetration of the knowledge filter.

This study aims to empirically examine the path relationship between tie strength, absorptive capacity and firm innovation performance in Chinese manufacturing industries, thus enhance our understanding on the mechanism between innovation network and innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have conducted a survey among Chinese manufacturers in four industries (textile and garment, household appliance, IT and electronics and motor vehicle assemblers) that are located in North, East, Central and South China, respectively, with a valid response from 278 manufacturers. Structural equation model is used to analyze the results. Findings: This study demonstrates that in Chinese Manufacturing industry, tie strength is positively related to innovation performance. The authors also find that absorptive capacity has a positive impact on innovation performance and it mediates the relationship between tie strength and innovation performance. Then, the authors analyze the effect of ownership, industry and sub-region, and the results show that in private firms and traditional manufacturers, and the firms located in North and Eastern China, tie strength has no direct effect on innovation outcomes, but it can influence innovation indirectly through absorptive capacity. Originality/value: This study further supports that in Chinese guanxi culture, strong ties with other innovation partners can improve the firm’s absorptive capacity and thus improve innovation performance. The results also suggest that a firm’s absorptive capacity has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between tie strength and innovation performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Absorptive capacity and R&D outsourcing","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009471168&doi=10.1016%2fj.jengtecman.2017.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=0ab6515c28d7c4df8ef5f61be96dd44d","I analyze the determinants of research and development (R&D) outsourcing, or investments in R&D purchased from external providers. I build on the knowledge-based view of the firm (KBV) and the concept of absorptive capacity to propose a separation between the mechanisms that form the potential absorptive capacity that enables the firm to identify and integrate outsourced R&D knowledge into the firm, from the mechanisms that form the realized absorptive capacity that enables the firm to use and transform outsourced R&D knowledge into innovation. First, I propose that firms that engage with foreign customers and with foreign suppliers develop the potential absorptive capacity, an ability to understand new and complex external knowledge that is useful for integrating it with firm-internal knowledge, and thus invest more in R&D outsourcing. Second, I argue that firms that have more skilled employees and invest more in internal R&D develop the realized absorptive capacity, an ability to use and transform external knowledge, and as a result invest more in R&D outsourcing. Finally, I propose that these relationships are weakened when the firms are subsidiaries of foreign multinational firms operating in the country, because these firms can also build their absorptive capacity by being integrated with other country subsidiaries and the headquarters within the multinational. I test these arguments on a sample of manufacturing firms and find that firms that import, export, have more skilled employees, and have more internal R&D investment tend to invest more in R&D outsourcing. I also find that, for subsidiaries of foreign firms, the impact of skilled employees and internal R&D on R&D outsourcing is lower than for domestic firms. These ideas provide a theory-driven explanation of the determinants of R&D outsourcing that refine the notion of absorptive capacity and its two dimensions, potential and realized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

It has a connection with absorptive capacity, a skill that allows the company to identify external knowledge, assimilate and apply it, but it's not clear in the literature how this relationship happens. An antecedent of knowledge sharing and absorptive capacity is goal orientation, which can be learning or performance goals. These goals exist in agile methodologies, which aim to foster team learning while delivering better quality software. This work intends to establish the relationship between knowledge sharing, absorptive capacity and goal orientation in the context of agile teams, which was done with a systematic literature review. As a result, six propositions have been established on the relationship of the constructs in the context of agile teams, with which managers can identify team orientation and create action plans for knowledge strategies."
"Measuring the impact of relational capital on customer performance in the SME B2B sector: The moderating role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032490782&doi=10.1108%2fBPMJ-10-2016-0205&partnerID=40&md5=e1fc2c898fed0333a6a51a0c78473dfb","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence that different components of relational capital (marketing capability, open innovation with business and scientific partners, technological reputation, brand) have on customer performance (CP). Moreover, the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on such relationships is tested. Design/methodology/approach: First, the direct relationship between the different components of relational capital and CP is analyzed through a linear regression model. Then, to test the moderating effect, two distinct regression analyses are conducted into two sub-samples, defined according to the level of absorptive capacity. The authors carried out these analyses on a sample of 150 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the medium- and high-tech B2B context. Findings: Results of this study prove that CP is enhanced through firm marketing capability, open innovation with business partners and technological reputation, while brand and open innovation with scientific partner do not have an association with CP. In particular, the impact of marketing capability and open innovation with business actors on CP is greater for firms with higher absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: This paper, highlighting the relevance of relational capital and absorptive capacity in improving CP, enhances our knowledge about the factors that help to strengthen the relationships with customers, which is an under-investigated issue especially for SMEs competing in B2B industries, and extends our knowledge on open innovation practices. Practical implications: Findings of this paper suggest that, to achieve better CP, managers should pay special attention to nurturing their marketing capability and high-quality relationships with external actors and invest in absorptive capacity to enhance the positive effect of such linkages. Originality/value: This work, combining the external perspective of relational capital and the internal organizational dimension of absorptive capacity, provides valuable insights about the knowledge and resource mix that firms might rely on to achieve better customer satisfaction and loyalty. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Therefore, regional disparities occur in various fields: social welfare, economic growth, infrastructure developments, etc. Sometimes the regional retardation (as a reflection of regional disparities) inhibits the progress and brings losses; sometimes otherwise, it encourages the flexibility and the implementation of new ideas. Especially retarding regions, seeking for socio-economic welfare, must search for new (specific, adapted to the context and circumstances) ways of acting. Indisputably innovations become the core of a socio-economic progress in all regions. And the development of absorptive capacity (individual, organizational, regional) as a main precondition for any innovative activity, leading to innovations, could create favorable preconditions to gain the competitive advantage. Therefore, this article draws linkages between levels of regional absorptive capacity and regional welfare by giving some evidences from Lithuania (a small European country). It argues that regional absorptive capacity can be understood as a cause and a consequence of the regional development process and be reflected by regional disparities. Results of the research illustrate the mutual connection: region with better socio-economic results has more possibilities to develop its absorptive capacity and to reach its higher level, needed for future development."

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses and bootstrap approach were applied to test the research model. Findings: Subjective well-being has significantly positive influence on individual innovation behavior, and this effect is mediated by knowledge sharing. Furthermore, absorptive capacity moderates the mediated relationships between subject well-being and individual innovation behavior via knowledge sharing. Practical implications: This research sheds light on an effective role to promote individual innovation behavior in management practices. It suggests that harmonious atmosphere, communication platform, and well-established learning plans can be cultivated to enhance individual innovation ability.

Using empirical survey data collected from 138 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we applied partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) combined with mediation and moderation analyses to test our hypotheses. Our results show that the effects of potential AC on organizations' exploratory and exploitative innovations are fully mediated by the organizations' realized AC. The positive effects of realized AC on innovation are contingent on the overall cultural balance of the organization, which, however, does not affect the strong link between potential AC and realized AC. We thus provide novel empirical insights into the multi-dimensional nature of AC and the importance of cultural equilibrium for both exploratory and exploitative innovation, which is of particular importance for ambidextrous SMEs facing dynamic markets. © 2017 The Authors."

This article undertakes an empirical investigation of the AP/Net - IP relationship and AC’s potentially moderating role in this relationship in an emerging country: Brazil. Statistical testing of hypotheses regarding these relationships, and AC’s role, corroborated the exceptions. However, it confirmed how important it is that firms in an emerging country ensure a high level of AC to mitigate the negative effects of AP/Net diversity on IP.

It is an article of great relevance, given the current situation of Brazilian electricity sector and the need for energy efficiency and the use of alternative sources of energy, specifically solar. The theoretical framework addresses the concepts on AC, as well as how to evaluate and measure them. A quantitative research was performed in order to evaluate the AC of these manufacturers, applying a diagnostic tool adapted to the reality of Brazilian companies. The results of this research concluded that these companies do not yet have mature AC for developing an innovative product, showing a higher tendency for the potential dimension of AC when compared to the realized dimension. This finding corroborates the prospects for future research and development projects if the surveyed companies strengthen their ability to promote interactions with other organizations devoted to that same purpose."

The authors argue that intellectual capital and other sets of intangible assets are mobilized by firms through dynamic capabilities such as ACAP. Product innovation is one of the results of this process. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was conducted, including 500 firms of different sizes, industries and technological intensities located in southern Brazil. The validity of constructs and the theoretical model were confirmed by structural equation modeling. Findings: The authors found that intellectual capital does influence ACAP, albeit differently on each of ACAP’s dimensions. Acquisition, assimilation and exploitation of knowledge are more decisively influenced by structural capital, followed by human capital. The ability of transformation of knowledge is evenly influenced by structural and human capital, and more moderately so by social capital. The results also showed that ACAP influences product innovation, but each of its dimensions demonstrated a different impact. Practical implications: This study helps practitioners to identify the development of a firm’s intangible resources and its influences on product innovation. This characterization can serve as a benchmark for managers or private and public companies to define strategies and policies to stimulate innovation.

First, to understand recombinant innovation (RI) as a potentially significant part of an open innovation (OI) strategy and second, to suggest key routines which would underpin a capability for RI, locating these within the context of enhanced absorptive capacity (AC). Finally, the paper considers how such routines could be developed, drawing on some case examples. Design/methodology/approach: The authors start with a literature review on OI and use the lens of AC to explore challenges in finding, assimilating and deploying external knowledge posed by the emerging knowledge-rich context of OI. The authors then explore one OI route – RI – and suggest a model framework for operationalizing it based on routines for search, acquisition, assimilation and deployment. Findings: The authors suggest three sets of routines required for RI, around abstract-driven search (ADS), brokerage and cyclic adaptation. As with much of the now widely available toolkit for OI, the challenge is one of moving from potential to realized opportunity and this will require investments in learning and capability building. Originality/value: The authors suggest that for organizations to enhance their AC around RI, three core routines are needed: ADS, brokerage and cyclic adaptation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

The data were collected from a sample of 248 local employees from 76 joint project engineering teams in the Nigerian upstream oil industry. Findings: ACAP entails individual and team capabilities, which depend on prior experience and need for cognition. The creation of shared understanding is essential for the transition of an individual’s knowledge assimilation capability into team’s knowledge utilization capability.

A framework with type of knowledge, absorptive capacity, disseminative capacity and tie strength is proposed. The framework is verified qualitatively and then further developed by adding another capacity needed by the headquarters: heeding capacity. Design/methodology/approach: To check the validity of the proposed conceptual framework empirically, interview-based qualitative studies were conducted for two partner programs implemented in the Japanese subsidiary of a US-based IT company. Interviews were undertaken with 17 respondents in the headquarters, the Japanese subsidiary and two alliance partners in Japan. Findings: It is confirmed that type of knowledge and absorptive capacity clearly affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Also, it is found that the knowledge sender’s disseminative capacity matters. Additionally, a case is found in which network ties mitigate the ineffectiveness caused by low disseminative/absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: In this research, cultural influences have not been considered. Also, this research has not paid attention to inter-organizational knowledge transfer. These provides potential for further research which could explore this complexity in more depth. Practical implications: It is suggested that the headquarters of a MNC need to have a “heeding capacity” in cases where the target subsidiary’s disseminative capacity is low and tie strength between the subsidiary and the headquarters is weak. It is a capacity for the headquarters to heed what a subsidiary would like to transmit but cannot do well, and this is achieved by listening carefully and not letting language barriers or cultural differences obfuscate the meaning. Originality/value: By focusing on a dyad between the headquarters and the Japanese subsidiary, the importance of disseminative capacity of a subsidiary is highlighted, which is not often the case in the extant literature. Also, headquarters’ heeding capacity is proposed. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

We propose using alliance-based network to explore external absorptive capacity and fill the gap of quantitative analysis of the internal and external absorptive capacity together by using social network analysis. In the meanwhile we combine learning effects and absorptive capacity together, to explain how internal absorptive capacity and alliance-based networks cause learning effect, which promotes firms to generate more technological innovation in their home countries and abroad. Using panel data from 306 Chinese firms in high-tech industries during 2001-2010, we find evidence that internal absorptive capacity and external collaborations in alliance-based networks do induce higher technology innovation output, which implies that learning effect depend on the combination of firm-internal and external knowledge. The absorptive capacities, whether internal or external, has positive impact on innovation. Such evidence of absorptive capacity effect has nothing to do with the market position in the process of learning, they are shared among domestic and overseas market Further, in terms of external absorptive capacity, higher network density and degree centrality in the firm's alliance-based network strengthen latecomers' innovation capacity. © Vilnius University, 2002-2017."
"Analysis of antecedent and consequence of employee engagement in small and medium-sized enterprises in Central Java, Indonesia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028056479&partnerID=40&md5=461e0dc36f47b820608ce4c83f509ecd","Nowadays, employee is considered essential in an organization. The active role of the employee should be concerned by practitioners and academicians. This study aimed to investigate the antecedent and consequent variables of employee engagement. Distributive justice, absorptive capacity, and job design were believed as the antecedent factors influencing work engagement. Meanwhile, organizational citizenship behavior was believed as the consequent or output factor of employee engagement. The respondents were 134 employees of SMEs in Central Java, Indonesia. The results showed that distributive justice and absorptive capacity influenced employee engagement, whereas job design had no significant influence on employee engagement. Moreover, employee engagement had an effect on organizational citizenship behavior."
"Enhancing effects of supply chain resilience: insights from trajectory and resource-based perspectives","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028311701&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-06-2016-0190&partnerID=40&md5=c81c2b1b38babe26594923006da223e7","Purpose: This paper aims to examine the operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity influencing proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience and implementation in inter-organizational relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a research model comprises six research hypotheses with five constructs, including trajectory, absorptive capacity, operating frontier, proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. The hypotheses are tested on data collected from 297 senior managers of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, using structural equation modeling. Findings: The study provides insights into how supply chain members can reinforce their operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity activities to improve proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. Research limitations/implications: The resultant findings cannot be generalized for all forms of supply chains, as they exclusively reflect those in Taiwan. With the research model developed, cross-industrial studies on various forms of supply chains would be worth conducting to investigate whether their inter-relationship effects differ in relation to inter-organizational supply chain resilience. Practical implications: This study provides multiple insights for managers and practices seeking to improve inter-organizational supply chain resilience, which have become increasingly popular because their factors enhance coping strategies to achieve corporate goals. The proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience can be effectively improved by enhancing trajectory, absorptive capacity and operating frontier. Originality/value: This empirical research attempted to fill the gaps created by trajectory and resource-based perspectives in inter-organizational supply chain resilience. This study reveals how supply chain members can reinforce the factors of their coping strategies (i.e. operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity) to make significant improvements, which is not dealt with in previous studies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this context, higher education institutions (HEIs) are an important source of innovation. Yet, despite the importance of universities, this topic has received scant academic attention. Thus, this research examines the effect of specific activities supported by universities on the innovation outcomes of firms. The study also investigates the moderating role of a firm's absorptive capacity in the relationship between universities' involvement and firm innovation outcomes. The findings show that specific types of HEI activities positively affect a firm's innovation performance, while absorptive capacity has differential effects on the relationships between HEI activities and firm innovation outcomes. © 2017."

This article builds on the specific contributions of 'extreme case' internationalization to advance literature in this field. We foster the understanding of the role of rare knowledge and the mechanisms that link knowledge acquisition to absorptive capacity dynamics used in the internationalization path of multinational enterprises (MNEs). We opt for in-depth qualitative research into the post-entry phase of 'extreme' (thus particularly crude) international joint venture (IJV) investment, and analyze the perspective of managers from a developed economy MNE located in a high-risk, weak-institutions host country. The firm's absorptive capacity and its interaction with external environments that are categorized into four distinct contexts are found to be contingent upon pro-Active experiential learning, concurrent to managerial willingness and simultaneous organizational commitments to learning and to exploiting rare knowledge. We thus uncover managerial perceptions of a knowledge gap identified as host-country challenges and resulting managerial solutions, which reveal rare learning opportunities and knowledge exploitation dynamics. The capacity to compensate for knowledge gaps is a critical key within the design and consolidation of an alternative internationalization path for developed-country MNEs. This challenges the traditional risk-return-commitment dependencies in prior literature. © 2016 The OR Society Ltd. All rights reserved 1477-8238/17."
"Acquirers’ prior related knowledge and post-acquisition integration: Evidences from four Chinese firms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021068886&doi=10.1108%2fJOCM-08-2015-0145&partnerID=40&md5=5d850669558081f96eb70562e59f0bfb","Purpose: This paper examines the role of acquirers’ prior related knowledge in the post-acquisition integration process. The purpose of this paper is to identify what constitutes the key prior related knowledge that can contribute to the reverse knowledge transfer following Chinese firms’ outward mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to Europe, and explain how prior related knowledge affects such transfer of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a multiple case study approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from February 2012 to June 2013 with 24 managers. Findings: The authors find that, in addition to knowledge about the target, prior international business experience, R&D capability, and industrial capabilities are key components of acquirers’ prior related knowledge that can contribute to the success of M&A integration and post-acquisition reverse knowledge transfer. Indeed, Chinese acquirers’ prior related knowledge can influence the reverse knowledge transfer from acquired firms to acquirers by directly improving acquirers’ absorptive capacity and building a harmonious organisational climate to facilitate such transfer. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the absorptive capacity and the cross-border M&A literature. It extends the current knowledge on the key components of an acquirer’s prior related knowledge in the outward M&A by Chinese firms. It also uncovers how post-acquisition reverse knowledge transfer is affected by acquirers’ prior related knowledge. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose an econometric approach based on a Hurdle Count Data Model which allows the authors not only to overcome problems related to the count dependent variables often assuming zero values, but also to separate patent propensity from patent portfolio size. Findings: This methodology puts in evidence that an internal factor (i.e. employee skills for innovation) significantly influences SME patent propensity, while an external factor (i.e. open innovation with business partners) impacts SME portfolio size. Moreover, both formal plan for innovation and absorptive capacity play an important moderating role. Originality/value: This paper embraces a knowledge perspective to investigate the determinants of SME patenting, which contributes to the knowledge-based view of the firm in the SME domain. Moreover, differently from most studies in the area of patenting which adopt a macro-level perspective and rely on secondary data, it assumes a firm-level approach and bases on primary data, which contributes to make it particularly distinctive. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a theoretical framework (tested through an international survey on a sample of 524 companies) grounded on the resource-based view theory, innovation management and operations management literature. Findings: The results show that innovation is positively affected by supplier collaboration, which in turn is favored by purchasing absorptive capacity. Empirical evidence also shows that purchasing status and innovation objectives enable the development of greater absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: Because of the survey approach, the research results are limited to the data collected. Researchers are encouraged to verify propositions with complementary methodologies (e.g. case studies). Practical implications: The findings confirm the relevant role of the purchasing interface in innovation as well as the positive impact of supplier collaboration, contributing both to existing literature and managerial practice in terms of successful collaborative new product development (NPD) processes. Originality/value: The study integrates three different research fields (innovation, operations, and purchasing management), providing a synergistic vision on the topic and considering, as a unit of analysis, the purchasing category level (rather than the NPD project level). © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory qualitative study was performed using semi-structured interviews with chief executive officers and innovation managers of 22 industrial firms and institutions from the machine-tool industry. Findings: Key forms of knowledge must be shared by the two agents. Producers have to obtain in-depth knowledge about customers’ needs and customers need knowledge on producer’s absorptive capacity. Producers distinguish between three types of customers: reference customers, necessary for innovations with greatest scope, clientes amigos or test users, required to test innovations currently being developed, and traditional customers, associated with incremental innovations. The traditional means of protecting innovations is a detailed contract between customer and supplier; and patents are used for innovations of greater technological scope, as a form of defense against third-party patents and as a signaling element of absorptive capacity. Originality/value: The paper draws on the direct experience of executives from companies whose innovation is based on a close relationship with customers to answer questions to which the literature has yet to provide definitive answers: What sort of information to be shared is relevant for the generation of innovations? Are all customers equal or are there profiles that contribute more effectively to the development of innovations? What attitude and mechanisms are most effective for protecting the knowledge and competitiveness generated through knowledge sharing? © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Departing from the construct of potential and realised absorptive capacity, the framework included the concepts of organisational learning, transactional memory systems and tacit and explicit knowledge transformation. The conclusion is that the QFD methodology is an important instrument for “knowledge creation and utilisation” in product innovation. The scientific evidence indicates that this often unrecognised capability can be a ‘hidden gem’ in methodology use. The matrix named the “House of Quality” emerged in an era when the QFD methodology foremost was regarded as a quality tool, but in the light of the findings, one could suggest that this matrix today could more properly be renamed as the “House of Knowledge”.

Drawing on the individual dimension of absorptive capacity, we clarify the antecedents of local team member's capability to acquire foreign partner's knowledge in joint ICT project team. Specifically, we proposed prior experience, learning goal orientation and need for cognition as antecedents to local employee's abilities to (1) recognise the value of and (2) assimilate foreign partner's knowledge. The hypothesised model was validated by the results of the structural equation modelling conducted using the data gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 205 local team members of joint ICT project teams in Malaysia. Most of the hypothesised relationships were supported, with further discussion focused on the non-supported relationships.

We build upon dynamic capabilities theory and conceptualize our research model through the lens of strategic alignment methods. Then, we empirically test our main hypothesis using PLS-SEM analysis on a sample of 322 international firms. Outcomes show that measurements and indicators of all first-order and higher-order constructs are reliable and valid. Results also indicate that there is a positive relationship between strategic alignment and competitive firm performance. This study highlights the importance of alignment between IT and organizational capabilities. Strategic alignment can, therefore, be seen an important facilitator of competitive firm performance in constantly changing environments.

However, despite the continuous implementation, a common phenomenon exists, i.e. lack of trust among crowdsourcing participants. Such lack may result in a lower rate of contract signing. The purpose of this study is to identity cognitive and affective determinants of initiators' willingness to sign a contract towards trust, and to understand the process of trust model in determining the trust formation mechanism. Results indicate perceived accreditation, network externality, absorptive capacity, track record and social capital are important in forming initiators' trust towards crowdsourcing platforms and bidders, which in turn will promote their signing intention. This study is unique in that it applies trust theory to propose a crowdsourcing trust model that incorporates bidder- and platform-related variables as determinants to predict initiators' willingness to sign a contract.

"Exploring the influence of big data on city transport operations: a Markovian approach","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008319877&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-03-2015-0179&partnerID=40&md5=11ea335089e105946830088ba7839fdf","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge of the transformative potential of big data on city-based transport models. The central question guiding this paper is: how could big data transform smart city transport operations? In answering this question the authors present initial results from a Markov study. However the authors also suggest caution in the transformation potential of big data and highlight the risks of city and organizational adoption. A theoretical framework is presented together with an associated scenario which guides the development of a Markov model. Design/methodology/approach: A model with several scenarios is developed to explore a theoretical framework focussed on matching the transport demands (of people and freight mobility) with city transport service provision using big data. This model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. Findings: This modelling study is an initial preliminary stage of the investigation in how big data could be used to redefine and enable new operational models. The study provides new understanding about load sharing and optimization in a smart city context. Basically the authors demonstrate how big data could be used to improve transport efficiency and lower externalities in a smart city. Further how improvement could take place by having a car free city environment, autonomous vehicles and shared resource capacity among providers. Research limitations/implications: The research relied on a Markov model and the numerical solution of its steady state probabilities vector to illustrate the transformation of transport operations management (OM) in the future city context. More in depth analysis and more discrete modelling are clearly needed to assist in the implementation of big data initiatives and facilitate new innovations in OM. The work complements and extends that of Setia and Patel (2013), who theoretically link together information system design to operation absorptive capacity capabilities. Practical implications: The study implies that transport operations would actually need to be re-organized so as to deal with lowering CO2 footprint. The logistic aspects could be seen as a move from individual firms optimizing their own transportation supply to a shared collaborative load and resourced system. Such ideas are radical changes driven by, or leading to more decentralized rather than having centralized transport solutions (Caplice, 2013). Social implications: The growth of cities and urban areas in the twenty-first century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. This paper is an initial first step in building theory, knowledge and critical understanding of the social implications being posed by the growth in cities and the role that big data and smart cities could play in developing a resilient and sustainable transport city system. Originality/value: Despite the importance of OM to big data implementation, for both practitioners and researchers, we have yet to see a systematic analysis of its implementation and its absorptive capacity contribution to building capabilities, at either city system or organizational levels. As such the Markov model makes a preliminary contribution to the literature integrating big data capabilities with OM capabilities and the resulting improvements in system absorptive capacity. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Second, this methodology is used in a research application focused on absorptive capacity internal capabilities with regard to the processes of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Third, an integrated framework for information and knowledge management systems is developed from this application. Findings: The systematic literature review approach provides a rigor that can assist in reducing researcher bias while simultaneously enabling the definition of a precise scope of review, with a clear explanation of selection criteria with the objective to find and review all the studies that are relevant to the search definitions.

The various strands of this literature converge on the notion that integrating customers creates access to use-related knowledge that is needed to better target future customers. In a similar vein, solution selling has emerged as a means to provide solutions that fulfil customers' demands as an alternative to selling products and services to an unknown, anonymous customer. Here, most research adopts a producer-centric view. Yet, little research exists that: 1) combines customer integration and solution selling; 2) considers service companies. Thus, the authors' aim was to investigate whether and how a transformation from being a service provider to being a solution provider influences the provider's relationship with the customer, affects customer-induced service and solution innovation, and shapes the provider's absorptive capacity. The authors employ a case study design and investigate a German medium-sized IT consulting firm. The main result is the identification of testable propositions stemming from expert interviews and additional company data.

This paper examines the value of alliance portfolio diversity and whether R&D human capital is the pathway through which alliance portfolio diversity influences innovation novelty. We reason that the absorptive capacity of R&D human capital determines a firm's potential gains from highly diverse alliance portfolios. Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for the period 2005–2012, results support the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association between alliance portfolio diversity and firm innovation performance reported in studies, suggesting that not only too little, but also too much alliance portfolio diversity may be detrimental to firm innovation performance. Findings emphasise the value of alliance portfolio diversity in high-technology industries to achieve explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Further, we find evidence that R&D human capital plays an important role in innovation novelty by partially mediating the relationship between alliance partner diversity and firm innovation performance, emphasising the importance of internal capabilities to harness external knowledge assets. This study provides valuable insights to managers aiming to increase the effectiveness of their alliance portfolios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper further shows that knowledge tacitness and relationship between knowledge senders and receivers will accentuate this positive relationship. Design/methodology/approach: To test the proposed model, a pooled panel data set based on 102 Korean firms that participated in three waves of National Korean Innovation Surveys conducted in 2002, 2005, and 2008 is constructed. Since the independent variables are lagged in the analysis, the panel data comprised 204 firm-year observations of the 102 firms. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the effect of innovation on knowledge search breadth. Findings: The authors found that absorptive capacity mediated the relationship between innovation and knowledge search breadth. This mediating relationship was stronger when a firm is not affiliated with any business group and operates in the high-technology industry. Research limitations/implications: This paper showed that innovation is not only a consequence of knowledge search as found in existing literature, but also is a precursor to knowledge search. Originality/value: This paper developed a novel theoretical model on innovation and knowledge search that highlights a virtuous cycle between innovation and knowledge search. Methodologically, the pooled panel data controlled for lagged effect and enhanced efficiency of econometric models, thus offered several advantages over cross-sectional data. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

The model has shown that visibility can be an important information-based capability for a buying firm to mitigate supplier risk. Such an importance, however, may not hold in all settings but is contingent on the power-dependence structure between a buyer and its supplier. In particular, under high dependence of buyer on supplier, visibility is more needed to mitigate risk. In reverse, the importance of visibility is reduced if buyer is not dependent on its supplier. Two sides of antecedents to visibility are also posited and tested. Design/methodology/approach - Seafood processing firms in Vietnam are surveyed to test the model. Reliabilities and validities of measures are tested before the structured analysis. To test the model, partial least square (variance-based structural equation modeling) with 500 boostrapping samples is used. Findings - For the samples of seafood processing firms in Vietnam, visibility into their suppliers are found to be the key in mitigating supplier risks when the firms depend highly on their suppliers. In the reverse cases, the importance of visibility is reduced. Visibility is also found to be anteceded by information technology integration between buying firms and their suppliers. Originality/value - The model helps develop and empirically test an important approach in proactively mitigating supplier risk. That is to develop buying firm's visibility into a key supplier. Further, the model is developed to test the ways that visibility can be built. Those include both soft and hard sides of facilitating information exchange from supplier to its buyer. Thus the model is contributed to both the literature of supplier risk and power-dependence. © Emerald Publishing Limited."

The business model mechanism constituting the management logics, core resources, value opportunities, and value activities sustains the firm value creation and appropriation. Superior execution of the business model mechanism sustained by the firm's entrepreneurial orientation provides a sustainable competitive advantage.

"Knowledge spillovers from inward foreign direct investment in the banking industry: An empirical examination in Korea","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032171487&doi=10.1108%2fMD-12-2016-0899&partnerID=40&md5=a1bd22bb7b9bba1c4ea4fea7e209bf29","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to pinpoint key conduits promoting knowledge spillovers through inward foreign direct investment in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The data were obtained by a survey. The survey data were collected from managers of five major local banks in Korea. The survey was conducted during May 10-June 30, 2015 with a total of 581 self-administered responses finally collected at the end (response rate: 60.5 percent). Findings: Based on the survey data collected from the survey, the results indicate that knowledge spillovers from foreign to local banks occur in the Korean context. Demonstration effect, worker mobility and absorptive capacity of local banks are found to be effective conduits for knowledge spillovers. In addition, the authors have also found that competitive pressure negatively influences worker mobility leading to knowledge spillovers while two other elements (i.e. demonstration effect and absorptive capacity) positively mediate the relationship between competitive pressure and knowledge spillovers. Practical implications: It is essential for the managers of multinational banks vigorously consider placing a strong emphasis on security of internal information and management of own personnel as the knowledge outflow through the demonstration effect and worker mobility is critical. For the managers of local banks, the discoveries suggest that active investment in human resources to maximize knowledge spillovers through the demonstration effect and through absorptive capacity is heightened by building an internal knowledge base. Originality/value: The study contributes to the extant literature in the field of international business in two key ways. First, it examines the knowledge spillovers in the banking sector, a regulated industry, in Korea where empirical research is sparse. This paper’s second contribution is the finding of the key conduits of knowledge spillover phenomena by predicting and identifying the elements which affect the magnitude of knowledge flows from foreign to local banks. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Host-country characteristics, corporate sustainability, and the mediating effect of improved knowledge: A study among foreign MNCs in Malaysia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037150898&doi=10.1108%2fMBR-07-2017-0042&partnerID=40&md5=7e97030805a63d19cbac49f83f85a06c","Purpose: Under the premise of resource-based view (RBV), this study aims to examine the influence of host-country characteristics (i.e. market environment, cultural factors, government policies and absorptive capacity) on improved knowledge acquired by means of intra-firm technology transfer and the latter’s subsequent effect on corporate sustainability among subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: The following study adopted a cross-sectional design. Quantitative data were collected through structured interview from the representatives of selected 252 subsidiaries of foreign-based MNCs located in Peninsular Malaysia. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that market environment, government policies and absorptive capacity significantly affect the adoption of innovative knowledge, which also has a significant positive effect on corporate sustainability. The findings also revealed a partial mediation of improved knowledge between market environment, government policies and absorptive capacity on corporate sustainability. Research limitations/implications: This study recommends that the host country should formulate and adopt trade and FDI friendly policies, as well as stricter intellectual property laws, and, at the same time, provide higher education and training to its citizens to maximize foreign investment and knowledge transfer. Originality/value: Apart from highlighting the under-researched issue of organizational sustainability, this study is unique in its approach of connecting the external environment of the host country with the internal knowledge of the firm and corporate sustainability in a single framework. The empirical findings of this study support the hypothesized relationships and thereby extend the scope of the contingency theory and RBV in addition to simultaneously enriching the existing intra-firm knowledge management literature, particularly in the Malaysian context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

This chapter proposes a model perspective in management of technology and innovation, including special requirements of fashion retailing. In particular, this chapter discusses the context of fashion retailing understood as product and brand-based characteristics. A case study-based methodology is then used to guide an analysis of antecedents and (expected) outcome of fashion retail innovation. IT-based innovation dominates, but innovation is suggested to include a broader scope of technologies. Contrary to innovation maturity models, this chapter proposes to consider innovation as a continuous refinement between dynamic capabilities and absorptive capacity where technologies must be adapted to the special characteristics of the fashion retail industry. © 2018 by IGI Global."

Drawing on the relational view of strategic management, the impact of relational capabilities on two forms of supply chain flexibility is examined – configuration flexibility (CF) for switching suppliers with minimal penalties, and planning and control flexibility (PCF) for altering supply schedules, quality, and delivery lead-time. Design/methodology/approach: Strategic- and tactical-level managers from 211 retail stores in the UK were surveyed. The authors validated a measurement model with structural equation modelling and tested four hypotheses on the mediating role of relational capabilities on supply chain flexibility and retail performance, controlling for size, duration of relationship, and market segment. Findings: Results showed that the three relational capabilities partially mediated the positive effect of CF and PCF on operational performance in big middle and niche retailers. Examining the interaction effect of the forms of flexibility on the relational capabilities and performance, the authors found positive interaction effects on TMS and OI but a non-significant effect on AC. Practical implications: In addition to providing novel theoretical insights on supply chain flexibility, the findings have practical implications for supplier selection and buyer-supplier relationship management. Originality/value: Overall, the study highlights the impacts of relational capabilities on adopted operational strategies such as flexibility, buyer-supplier relationships, and retail performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Industry clock-speed influences investments in product and technology development, strategic priorities and innovation processes, and how a firm engages with its supply network to leverage supplier knowledge and unique competencies. However, the literature suffers from insufficient discussion concerning how differences in industry clockspeed affect innovation-fostering practices and innovation performance of firms. We address this unexplored issue in this paper by means of a comparative case study. We investigate the innovation-fostering practices of two firms, one in a low clock-speed industry and the other in a high clock-speed industry, to delineate the differences and similarities. The principal conclusion reached is that while industry clock-speed does not affect the innovation-fostering practices per se, the ways in which the practices are utilised differ greatly, which we detail based on the case studies. The differences pertain to open versus closed innovation, network ties, controlled versus flexible approaches, formal versus informal knowledge management systems, external knowledge integration and absorptive capacity.

Design/methodology/approach: The study proposed a model relating external knowledge, internal knowledge and IP that was tested using Bayesian structural equation modeling with a sample of Italian manufacturing firms of Community Innovation Survey 2010. It was run separately for high-tech firms (including HT and medium-HT aggregations of manufacturing industries of NACE Rev. 2) and low-tech firms (including LT and medium-LT aggregations). Findings: The results showed a difference between high-tech and low-tech manufacturing firms in Italy. The investments to leverage internal knowledge sources are important for high-techs and not significant for low-techs. On the other hand, the level of external KS improves significantly the IP of low-techs and has a negative effect for high-techs. The level of absorptive capacity is central to improve the positive effect of the external knowledge on the IP for all firms, but it is still underdeveloped. Originality/value: The effects of 2008 economic crisis hit the Italian manufacturing industry specifically hard and are still felt. Innovation is a solution for firms’ growth and Italy is considered a below-average innovator country in Europe. The study could identify important gaps in Italian manufacturing firms that hinder their innovative performance improvement. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

It has been argued that the inclusion of Mexico in the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 would be enough to catch up with Canada and the United States. In this regard, trade liberalisation and foreign direct investment (FDI) would have been two strategic tools to close the technology gap between Mexico and its commercial partners in North America. Yet, after twenty years of NAFTA, it has been demonstrated that many indigenous firms in Mexico must develop an absorptive capacity to benefit from FDI. This paper suggests that the debate on the Asian miracle in the 1990s could be an adequate theoretical framework to discuss technology development and industrialisation in the case of emerging economies. In fact, this debate reveals two alternative approaches to explain the development of technology capabilities: (i) the accumulation view of growth, and (ii) the assimilation view of growth. Therefore, the Asian miracle exemplifies how entrepreneurship, learning and a supporting innovation policy could be an adequate strategy to benefit from FDI and technology spillovers in the case of emerging economies. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios."

The purpose of this paper is to examine how R&D investment affects the relation between IT investment and firm performance and under what circumstances R&D intensity is more beneficial to IT returns. Such study has been lacking in R&D research and IT payoff literature. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model for linking IT investment, R&D investment, environmental dynamism and firm performance was developed and tested by data collected from Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2013, using fixed effects regression model. Findings: The results show positive moderating effects of firm R&D investment and government R&D subsidies on the relation between IT investment and firm performance. Furthermore, the impact of firm R&D investment on IT payoff is stronger for firms in more dynamic environments. The findings suggest that R&D investment creates additional business value through interactions with IT, and complementarities between R&D and IT, as manifested in their interaction effect on firm performance vary across industry sectors. Research limitations/implications: This paper indicates the importance of complementarities between R&D and IT, which should prove helpful to researchers and practitioners engaged in Chinese business. Originality/value: This paper presents one of the first attempts at examining the moderating effect of R&D investment on the relation between IT investment and firm performance.

Findings: In total, four categories of themes were identified, namely, human-centric, focal organization-centric, supply chain-centric and governance-centric. Challenges were classified into seven categories, namely, inadequate and asymmetric knowledge, difficulties of operationalization, shifting the values, subjectivity in evaluation, governance complexity, difficulties of small- and medium-sized enterprises and sustainability fade. Research limitations/implications: The focus of the article is on the social pillar of sustainable development in the context of supply chains. A more holistic systematic investigation of synergy of all the three pillars/bottom lines of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social) can be an opportunity for further research. Practical implications: Taking a more holistic view of the pattern of currently discussed themes and challenges may be beneficial in increasing the absorptive capacity of industrial and business practitioners, by accumulating and assimilating external knowledge, when they design and operationalize innovative strategies in developing sustainable supply chains. Originality/value: This article may increase awareness about the social responsibilities of supply chains actors and stakeholders in different scales. It may also guide managers, decision makers and practitioners to better understand the difficulties, obstacles or dilemmas that can hinder the sustainable development of supply chains. The results section presents a framework driven from the emerged themes, and the discussion section provides propositions for tackling the challenges and opportunities for further research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Effects of regulations and competition on the innovativeness-performance relationship: Evidence from the financial services industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028560368&doi=10.1108%2fIJBM-06-2016-0079&partnerID=40&md5=ead8970edc2b96b2255000406d74586c","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature and the extent of moderation effect of the regulatory regime and competition, on the innovativeness-performance relationship among financial services firms. Based on the absorptive capacity theory, this study argues that firms must gather adequate knowledge from the external environment (specifically on regulatory systems and competitive landscape) to assist in developing competitive innovation strategies, and to realize the needed performance benefits from such strategies. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the Ghana’s financial services sector with a focus on banking and insurance institutions. Structural equation modeling and regression models were specified to test both the direct effects of variables of interest, and the moderation effects of environmental factors on the independent and dependent variables. Findings: The results of the study show that both process and product innovativeness enhance financial services firms’ performance. While competition was found to stifle innovativeness, regulatory regime was found to promote innovativeness in financial services. Regulatory regime was also found to positively moderate the relationship between process innovativeness and performance, while competition was found to positively moderate the relationship between product innovativeness and performance. Research limitations/implications: The firms sampled are from an emerging economy with a growing financial services sector, and as a result, the findings may not apply to contexts with different economic characteristics. Originality/value: This study asserts that in enhancing innovativeness in the financial services markets, firms must recognize the value of new external information on regulatory regime and competition as key environmental factors. Financial service firms must assimilate, transform, and apply such new knowledge in their innovation efforts in order to improve performance. For firms to fully benefit from their innovation, process innovativeness must be aligned with regulatory systems while product innovation yields best returns in competitive periods. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"An investigation into the factors influencing the outsourcing decision of e-banking services: A multi-perspective framework","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017610957&doi=10.1108%2fJGOSS-05-2016-0016&partnerID=40&md5=d3dc99b6ce8aaa19ce86df5b24dabf29","Purpose: This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis toward understanding the critical factors in affecting information technology outsourcing (ITO) decision in the context of e-banking services in Iran. Within the recent decades, outsourcing IT processes and services as a strategic decision has been widely adopted throughout industries. In this regard, scholars have investigated a wide range of factors influencing ITO decision in various contexts. Design/methodology/approach: This research examines a conceptual model that shows impacts of different attributes including technological, organizational and environmental on the Iranian banks’ ITO decision. To validate the research hypotheses, the partial least squares (PLS) technique for data analysis, is utilized. Findings: The results of this study derived from the theoretical discussion of hypotheses illustrated that 9 of 11 assumed factors (i.e. perceived tangible benefits, perceived intangible benefits, perceived risks, perceived information security/privacy, complete contract establishment capability, making strong trustworthy relationship capability, uncertainty in business requirements, external pressure and market maturity) influence ITO decision in the target industry. The findings also confirmed that the size of the bank and competitors’ absorptive capacity did not exert any influence on their service outsourcing decision. Research limitations/implications: The sampling was confined to experts in the banking industry. Also, the results of this study reflect Iranian perspective. Consequently, generalization based on this sample would be interpreted cautiously and a limitation of the context should be kept in mind. Originality/value: Insights into policymaking for suitable drivers to outsource e-banking services in the context of a less developed country are the main outcomes of the current research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Discovering complexity and emergent properties in project systems: A new approach to understanding project performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994275482&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijproman.2016.10.004&partnerID=40&md5=b8b5af56dff3a804c335c98a77728c9e","An integrated performance assessment framework based on consideration of complexity and emergent properties in project systems is proposed in this study. The fundamental premise of the proposed Complexity and Emergent Property Congruence (CEPC) framework is that a greater level of congruence between project emergent properties and complexity can potentially increase the possibility of achieving performance goals in construction projects. Two dimensions of project complexity (i.e., detail and dynamic complexity) and three dimensions of project emergent properties (i.e., absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities) in the proposed CEPC framework were verified through information collected from in-depth interviews with nineteen senior project managers. In addition, contributing factors to different dimensions of project complexity and emergent properties were identified from the interviews. The results highlight the significance of the CEPC framework in understanding complexity and emergent properties in project systems and providing a new theoretical lens for project performance assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA"
"Antecedents of SME alliance performance: a multilevel review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035081155&doi=10.1108%2fMRR-12-2016-0286&partnerID=40&md5=ce59f4d6035e8ad41d799d4a60a305cd","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to classify and analyze the impact of antecedents studied in the extant literature on two levels of SME alliance performance – alliance-level and firm-level. Design/methodology/approach: Using online databases and the bibliography section of the selected articles, 45 peer-reviewed studies specifically analyzing the impact of antecedents on the performance of SME alliances at the two levels were studied to gain insights. Findings: The study differentiates between the impact of antecedents on the two levels of SME alliance performance, alliance-level and firm-level, and finds that certain antecedents, such as absorptive capacity, corporate entrepreneurship, control, network dimensions, partner opportunism and partner reputation, have a peculiar impact on a single level while other antecedents such as trust, commitment and cooperation, have an influence on performance at both levels. Also, the impact of these antecedents is hypothesized to be weak or strong, depending upon the results obtained by the papers in the review. Research limitations/implications: In a first-of-its-kind approach, the paper provides a conceptual insight into the differentiating impact of antecedents on SME alliance performance at both levels, as opposed to the unitary analysis approach used in the extant literature. The model provided by the study can be used by researchers to gain a systematic understanding of how alliance outcomes are affected. Practical implications: While the extant literature remains largely ambiguous on the role of antecedents causing variance in SME alliance outcomes, this paper serves to bridge this gap and enhance the understanding of practitioners by systematically analyzing how specific antecedents affect SME alliance performance at both levels. Originality/value: As opposed to the unitary approach used in the extant literature, which does not differentiate between the two levels of SME alliance performance, this paper arranges and categorizes these studies based on the level at which alliance performance has been analyzed. Furthermore, the paper identifies the impact of antecedents at each level, thereby providing pioneering insights on understanding SME alliance outcomes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Modeling Iranian innovation network in nanotech for policy: applying an adopted version of SKIN model","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021736808&doi=10.1108%2fJSTPM-08-2016-0017&partnerID=40&md5=fffeaa89b1e9374e84fc7fe67b9343c7","Purpose: Iran Nanotechnology Initiative Council could significantly increase the production of scientific articles in the field by imposing ten-year incentive policies so that Iran ranked 7 in this area in the year 2015. But this progress was insufficient to speed up the production and commercialization of nanotechnology products and Iran ranked 44 with a share of 0.03 per cent of nanotechnology production in the world. Therefore, Iran Nanotechnology Initiative Council as a governmental policymaker institution in this area has sought for the policy threefold increase of funding to speed up the production and commercialization of products in this field. But given that the result was not so clear, this research was formed in the form of modeling Iran Nanotechnology Innovation Network and testing various scenarios to increase its efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses simulation framework of innovation networks (SKIN) in an attempt to model the production innovation network in Iran in the field of nanotechnology that can measure the effect of incentive policies in changing the network structure and, consequently, increasing the level and pace of innovation in it. Given that the volume of articles produced in Iranian universities in the field of Nanotechnology had a high speed and volume in comparison with the volume of technical knowledge produced by companies, and because the SKIN framework did not consider the distinction between the two, in the first step, the framework is developed using the model of absorptive capacity of knowledge provided by Cohen and Levinthal (1990) and then the developed model was used to model the Innovation Network. Findings: Finally, two policies of threefold increase of budget (Scenario 1) and increasing the support for joint projects (with maintaining the current budget level) (Scenario 2) were tested in this model. The social network analysis method was used to analyze the results of the two scenarios, where innovation network topology was compared (as an index to measure the network efficiency) in three states of current status of the network (the baseline scenario), implementing the first and second scenarios of extraction and with each other. Originality/value: This paper models Iranian Nanotechnology Innovation Network for studying the evolution of the network as a result of executing different supportive scenarios. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Mergers and acquisitions in Brazilian industry: a study of spillover effects","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008400504&doi=10.1108%2fIJPPM-11-2014-0179&partnerID=40&md5=3ffb51333fc4c1d35653939de772931f","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of different kinds of merger and acquisitions (M&As) on domestic industries’ productivity in the form of technological change (TC) and efficiency change (EC) in the Brazilian extracting and processing industries. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis is employed to test the impact of different kinds of M&As spillovers on each component of productivity growth. The database contains data collected from 2007 to 2011 referring to the Brazilian industries. The estimation procedure involves two stages. The first stage decomposes TFP growth into EC and TC using a input-based Malmquist Productivity Index. In the second step, EC and TC indexes are used interchangeably as a dependent variable in panel data regressions on the M&As-spillover variables. Findings: The results indicate a positive relationship between TC and M&As made by Brazilian majority capital acquiring foreign-held capital from a company established abroad, which is consistent with reverse spillover theory. They also suggest an inverse relationship between TC and M&A operations made by companies with foreign majority capital acquiring both Brazilian-held capital and foreign-held capital from a company established in Brazil. Only the sectors that are capable of increasing their productivity via TC are able to benefit from technology transfer. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by the extent of data aggregation applied, which did not identify M&A transaction effects at the firm level. The available data do not allow isolating the effects of M&A processes on industry performance, given the co-occurrence of several factors that affect the performance of the industry. The study results imply that public managers must remain cognizant of the critical need to preserve and maximize competition between foreign and domestic firms while promoting a competitive environment that encourages the development of domestic technological capacities and skilled human capital. Practical implications: M&A processes raise important issues with respect to organizational decisions and industrial policy. Studies of M&A transactions may be of fundamental importance to the expansion of healthy companies as they evolve through successive stages of growth and development. Liberalizing regulations to promote M&A transactions, and corporate market control is only justified if it promotes social welfare and economic development. Understanding the complexity and dynamics of this phenomenon and appreciating the heterogeneity of possible outcomes can lead to more relevant discussion regarding their contributions. Social implications: Results found in this study indicate the need for greater efforts to understand how M&A operations, especially those associated to foreign-held capital, interact with local owned enterprises in developing economies and what benefits can be achieved through public policy. M&A operations need to be well evaluated by considering the kinds and intensities of externalities they might generate, whether and how local firms can potentially internalize those gains, building up absorptive capacities in order to achieve productivity spillover gains. Originality/value: This study not only offers a more accurate understanding of the diverse nature and effects of M&A operations, but also stimulates a more relevant public policy discussion related to both foreign direct investment and OFDI incentives in Brazil. The growing economic importance of the activities of developing emerging countries’ multinational enterprises is making governments more inclined to re-evaluate their political strategies. Indeed, governments are beginning to recognize that markets need to be created, monitored and nurtured. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

A qualitative approach using ten case restaurants assessed adaptive, absorptive and innovative capabilities and, how they relate with degree of inward internationalization. The study establishes that food quality assurance, food authenticity, personalized service and security assurance are used by ethnic restaurants to increase food tourist inflows. The study further found that knowledge absorption capacity helped ethnic restaurants to attract and retain food tourists. The study also found that innovative capabilities including adoption of new technology, adopting eclectic approaches and the ability to provide a wide assortment of dishes and regular menu updates was very instrumental in enhancing the level of inward internationalization. As such, the study through three models provides a theoretical explanation for the degree of inward internationalization of African-ethnic restaurants, and presents its theoretical, methodological, policy and managerial implications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
"Examining project learning, project management competencies, and project efficiency in project-based firms (PBFs)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020441026&doi=10.1108%2fIJMPB-04-2016-0035&partnerID=40&md5=524e8d44dfd25f5cc60d6a034a4e8ced","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use survey data to rank the relative importance of perceived factors that inhibit the transfer of knowledge across projects and examine the statistical relationship between various “higher order” dimensions of project management competencies and project efficiency among a sample of project-based firms (PBFs). Design/methodology/approach: The research philosophical approach adopted was post-positivism, a half-way house between positivism and phenomenological approaches. The author used a largely structured survey questionnaire with an inclusion of few open-ended items. The survey data collected were largely based on the “perceptions” of mostly experienced project management practitioners, whose perspectives on project processes and performance are likely to be more dependable. Because of budget limitations, a total of 260 questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected PBFs (with an enclosed self-addressed and stamped return envelope). Of the 260 questionnaires sent to PBFs, 58 questionnaires were returned, representing a return rate of just over 22 percent. Findings: Results indicate that “high time pressures towards the end of the project,” “too much focus on short-term project deliverables,” and “fear of negative sanctions when disclosing project mistakes” were three top-ranked factors that inhibited knowledge transfer across projects. Some “higher order” project management competencies like “dynamic competencies” have relatively a greater impact on predicting project efficiency. Dynamic competencies will only continue to increase in importance as today’s project environments are characterized as continuously evolving, turbulent, and complex and require the need to be effective in dealing with various uncertainties. Once included in the regression equation, the “ownership variable” dominates all other explanatory variables in predicting project efficiency among a sample of PBFs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), most likely driven by the project management competencies of multinational corporations (MNCs). However, the project efficiency of state-owned PBFs did not differ significantly from that of “international firms that were not MNCs.” Specific conditions may have led to such an outcome. The author shows that enhancing project efficiency requires the reinforcement of multiple but specific factors. Research limitations/implications: As the study was largely conducted on a limited budget and time frame, the author was not able to employ a multi-method approach. The inclusion of a few case studies would have facilitated triangulation of the current findings. In addition, the study captures “perceptions” and practical experiences of project management practitioners. Future studies could possibly develop what may be seen as “objective” measures of project learning and project management competencies. A larger survey supported by a larger budget would be one option in which some of the findings could be tested across PBFs located in different sectors and countries. Practical implications: The author argues that the creation of a client-led “no-blame culture” within PBFs can ensure the development of a “safe” environment in which project team members can acknowledge project mistakes without the fear or danger(s) that may come with such admission. This may require changes in project organizational culture that reduces power distance, lowers sensitivity to hierarchal power relations, enhances team building efforts, and fosters a “learning climate” that tolerates “trial and error” experimentation. It may also require strengthening clients’ specific capabilities. Such change may require time and patience but could take advantage of “positive” aspects of participatory practices, personal relationships, and consensus decision-making approach that is prevalent in the UAE culture. One managerial implication points to the need to tailor scarce resources in building up multi-dimensional “higher order” competencies like “dynamic competencies” that have a relatively higher significant impact on enhancing project efficiency. Linking MNCs with local PBFs as collaborative mega project delivery partners may lead to enhancing project management competencies of the latter, conditional on their absorptive capacity. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper is in providing survey-based empirical evidence that goes beyond case studies to highlight the importance of enhancing “higher order” project management competencies, such as “dynamic competencies,” that have a stronger predictive power of project efficiency in PBFs. The study also ranks the relative importance of various factors that inhibit the transfer of new knowledge across projects. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study that has demonstrated the statistical relationship between “higher order” project management competencies and project efficiency. Project efficiency is a multi-faceted construct. Its strengthening is determined by a configuration of multiple but specific factors. A more “nuanced” understanding of the relationship between project management competencies and project efficiency in a particular context may be required. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Managing market intelligence: The comparative role of absorptive capacity and market orientation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973525421&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2016.03.064&partnerID=40&md5=862cdddef38880e06b3b08e6f7eeb13c","Technological knowledge and market knowledge are among the most valuable resources that a firm can utilize for competitive advantage. Absorptive capacity (ACAP) or a firm's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and apply knowledge, has long been a central construct in organizational studies. Yet, limited research exists on ACAP in a marketing context. Marketers tend to utilize market orientation (MO) in similar theoretical contexts. This study extends the scope of ACAP beyond a technology-related context and develops a model to compare the performance of both potential and realized ACAP as well as that of MO to assess shared performance in a market-related context. The survey results suggest that ACAP of market knowledge positively influences firm performance by enhancing customer acquisition & retention of the firm.The findings also indicate that market orientation operates through the innovation process to add its effects to that of ACAP. Finally, this study discusses the moderating role of a firm's balance in cost leadership and differentiation strategy, suggesting comparative and distinguishable effects of ACAP of market knowledge and market orientation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

There is a need to cross-seed the variables that take part in the companies' decision-making process in order to identify how firms' characteristics influence their innovative activities. In this paper, we focus on the sustainable innovations (which we call eco-innovation) and compare knowledge-based versus non-knowledge-based (operational) firms' patterns, also considering manufacturing versus service sectors. To do so we rely, theoretically, on the well-known absorptive capacity model. The method used is the PLS multigroup analysis and the sample selected consists of a secondary dataset of +5900 data points from the 2012 Innovation Spanish Panel (PITEC). Results show that, on one hand, there is no difference in the way that firms acquire and assimilate knowledge and that knowledge-intensive firms excel to transform their ability to eco-innovate. On the other hand, manufacturing firms are one step further than service firms in their eco-innovative orientation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

The early calls for microfoundations in management research argued that strategy and organization theory focused on firm-level explanations of outcomes such as competitive advantage, profit, innovation, inertia, or absorptive capacity with too little attention to the entities and mechanisms at lower levels of analysis, notably, individuals and their interactions, and how these drove firm-level outcomes. Lippman and Rumelt (2003a) provocatively argued that properly accounting for the value appropriation of all factors of production implies that there is no firm-level residual called 'profit.' Felin and Hesterly (2007) very strongly emphasize the explanatory primacy in management research of individuals. An important motivation behind the micro-foundations research agenda is arguably the desire to engage in 'reduction,' which is often seen as a hallmark of scientific inquiry. Coleman (1990: 3-4) identifies additional reasons why micro-foundations are critical. Thus, Coleman suggests that macro-level explanation cannot discriminate between the many potential alternative lower-level explanations of macro-level behaviour because of a fundamental problem of unobserved mechanisms. Based on different psychological premises, Hodgkinson and Healey (2011) argue that such approaches need to be supplemented with insight into managerial emotion and affect, and building on recent advances in social cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics they demonstrate how doing this leads to additional insight in dynamic capabilities."

This study employs a time-varying stochastic frontier approach for firm level panel data of Indonesian manufacturing industry and performs a non-parametric test of the closeness of two distributions. The results demonstrate that foreign firms achieve higher productivity but less efficient than domestic firms. Increasing degrees of foreign ownership is negatively related to firms’ productivity but positively related to firms’ efficiency. There are positive horizontal spillover effects of foreign direct investment on the firms’ productivity and efficiency. The backward spillovers have positive impact on firm’s efficiency, and the forward spillovers have positive impact on firm’s productivity. However, there are negative backward spillover effects on firms’ productivity and negative forward spillover effects on firms’ efficiency. Besides that, within the same market technology spillover from FDI are smaller with higher level of labour quality. In the upstream market, the degree of absorptive capacity of suppliers has a negative impact on firms’ productivity but have a positive impact on reducing inefficiency. In the downstream markets, the greater ability of the buyers to identify, assimilate and exploit knowledge spillovers, the greater the impact on increasing productivity but the lesser the impact on reducing inefficiency. Finally, this study finds that all components of productivity; technological progress, technical efficiency change and scale efficiency change significantly contribute in explaining the TFP growth. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

This article explores the combination of mechanisms used by firms in Andalusia, a peripheral region in Spain and Europe, when interacting with universities. Using information from a survey of 737 innovative firms, the empirical study found evidence that university–industry links can be grouped into five latent dimensions (knowledge generation and adaptation, involvement in new organisations, training and exchange of human resources, intellectual property rights, and facilities and equipment) which are mainly based on exploitation or exploration activities. A typology of firms was created, highlighting the large number of firms with no interactions, and six clusters that specialize in specific mechanisms (IPR exploiters, Institutionalized interactors, University facility users, Training and education beneficiaries, Tacit knowledge users, and R&D interactors). The study also presents the determinants for engaging in each type of channel, concluding that whilst firms developing exploitation activities also develop parallel exploration activities, the reverse is not significant. The absorptive capacity of firms is important in determining the type of interaction, but is not fully conclusive about the range of exploration and exploitation activities. The article ends by discussing the policy implications associated with incentives to adapt knowledge transfer mechanisms to the industrial fabric of peripheral innovation systems. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

In this study, controllable ""electrical heating with thermal storage/accumulators"" is used as the peak regulation and dispatch resource. The purpose of this paper is: to reduce the forced electricity output of combined head and power (CHP) units; to get a lower load peak and a higher load valley when it is hard to regulate the peak; to increase the wind power penetration in winter; and to form a load dispatch model featuring source-load coordination. To conduct an in-depth study of thermoelectric coupling of CHP units, we created a thermoelectric decoupling scheme wherein the thermal power loss is compensated by wind power-thermal storage system. An economic dispatch model was proposed. Case studies showed that the proposed dispatch scheme using ""electric boilers with heat accumulators"" enables the grid to accommodate more wind power and optimize economic targets. Therefore, the proposed scheme should be widely applied. © 2016 IEEE."

This paper addresses that question by analysing the decision to innovate and the number of innovations introduced. Our findings, which are based on a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, confirm that R&D is more effective when firms also invest in worker training. Moreover, for some smaller firms, investing in workers’ skills (via training programs) boosts innovation even in absence of R&D. Meanwhile, on-the-job training in large firms might serve mainly to reinforce the effects of R&D.

Previous research also confirms cross effects of these dimensions in firms’ performance. The present study extends the literature on this subject by introducing absorptive capacity (AC) as a moderator of the relationship among market orientation, the interaction of market orientation and marketing capability, and firms’ new product performance. This study empirically examines the research model using survey data from 188 manufacturing firms in Sweden. The findings confirm previous studies that claim a positive relationship among market orientation, marketing capability, and new product performance. More importantly, the results indicate that AC positively moderates the relationship between market orientation and firms’ new product performance. Furthermore, the findings suggest that experts should consider AC as a competitive factor in line with the complimentary effect of market orientation and marketing capability.

We examine growth in relative South–North labour intensities (South–North convergence) for 31 industrialised source and eight emerging recipient countries. We find strong evidence that various components and individual indicators of absorptive capacity interact with imports of investment goods in such a way that the relative labour intensity is reduced. GMM and GLS estimations corroborate the results. Policies that improve various of the identified aspects of absorptive capacity are more promising than policies that select only one.

While the synergies between technology inflows and outflows have been discussed in conceptual OI articles, the majority of empirical studies have typically focused on either the inward or the outward dimension of OI. According to recent reviews of OI literature, there is a need for further research that takes an integrated perspective on this topic and studies the combination of the inbound and outbound dimensions of OI. This paper follows these calls by focusing on technology licensing as the main contractual form for OI, and by investigating the relationship between technology in-licensing and out-licensing activities at the firm level of analysis. In particular, this paper argues that technology in-licensing positively influences the volume of technology out-licensing through two mechanisms. The first—resource-based—occurs because in-licensing investments expand and enrich the firm's technology base, thus increasing its value and, as a result, creating more opportunities for out-licensing. The second—capabilities-based—occurs because, due to commonalities between technology in-licensing and out-licensing in terms of performed tasks and required skills, repeated execution of in-licensing transactions contributes to the development of higher out-licensing capabilities and, as a result, increase out-licensing volume. These arguments are tested using a panel dataset of 837 Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2007. Consistent with the predictions, the empirical analysis shows that higher investments in in-licensing and more extensive in-licensing experience lead to superior volumes of technology out-licensing. These results contribute to research on OI and licensing, by empirically showing the existence of positive interactions between technology inflows and outflows and of synergies in the development of absorptive and desorptive capacities. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association"

This paper also attempts to compare the levels of openness between firms in different industries to discover similarities and differences in OI phenomena. The analysis of data obtained from a survey of Korean firms shows significant interrelations between openness, OI capacities and firm performance.

Meanwhile, studies have shown that individual-level behaviors known as organizational citizenship behaviors are related to indicators of organizational performance, yet there have been relatively few theoretically-based arguments explaining this relationship. In this paper, we articulate a model that depicts how the organizational citizenship behaviors of individuals enhance a firm's absorptive capacity.

The case study investigated was a Brazilian corporation that has been doing business in the paper and corrugated cardboard industry for 72 years. The paper describes a case analysis demonstrating that adoption of practices associated with absorptive capacity has potential to foster intellectual capital, which is particularly important for development of innovations. These practices include assimilation of new technologies; creating capacity to utilize existing internal knowledge held by employees; use of benchmarking; application of technical knowledge; and registration of patents. Triangulation of data provided evidence confirming that the relationship between absorptive capacity and intellectual capital is a driver of innovation in the firm investigated. Additionally, this relationship is better explained by the mediating role of absorptive capacity, which is capable of potentiating intellectual capital to foster innovation. � 2016, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
"Innovation system strengths and weaknesses in progressing sustainable technology: The case of Swedish biorefinery development","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969695210&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2016.04.109&partnerID=40&md5=c8eda7c1a043103bb08e8513c527fb59","Based on the combination of economic challenges and uncertain policy conditions in the United States, European Union, and elsewhere, the development of advanced biorefineries has progressed slower than anticipated. This has delayed the transition to a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy. In this article, we adopt the technological innovation system (TIS) approach to analyze advanced biorefinery development in Sweden, a front-runner country in current development. The analysis highlights a number of system strengths (e.g., long-term research funding; significant research infrastructure; strong actor networks) that have contributed to developing the Swedish TIS, but also important system weaknesses (e.g., weak coordination among ministries; lack of industrial absorptive capacity; unclear roles) inhibiting it. The article highlights a combination of four policy measures that build on the system strengths to address the system weaknesses: (a) the implementation of a deployment policy for creating domestic niche markets; (b) improved policy timing and more structured coordination among different governmental agencies; (c) the provision of stronger incentives for mature industries to invest in R&D and improve their absorptive capacity; and (d) improved organization and financing of existing research infrastructure. In addition to the empirical contribution, the article contributes with novel insights into the TIS framework by highlighting the dynamics between system strengths and weaknesses, and suggests that system strengths should be better emphasized in future TIS studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

The research method is based on construction of composite indicators describing national performance within five innovation capabilities in two periods: 1998–2000 and 2010–2012 as well as regression analysis in order to test the accuracy of the main findings. The study has allowed to arrive at a conclusion that CEECs have been able to catch up to highly developed European economies with respect to absorptive capacity related to the existence and use of technological infrastructure as well as participation in inward technology transfer in the form of FDI and capital goods imports. There is, however, a lingering performance gap in new knowledge and innovation creation capabilities and R&D effort. Continuation of this trend and lack of considerable improvement also in terms of absorptive capacity related to the quality of human resources might result in CEECs’ permanent inability to catch up to their highly developed European counterparts. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press."

SMEs' absorptive capacity allows them to access knowledge and plays a key role in their ability to explore and exploit opportunities in their environment. Therefore, this study aims to identify and categorize knowledge management practices which SMEs can adopt to develop absorptive capacity. From a population of 4,534 Portuguese SMEs, 260 usable completed questionnaires were returned. We concluded that Portuguese SMEs are engaged in knowledge management practices, through collaboration with business partners, favoring learning processes based on experience, knowledge transfer to employees and knowledge absorption by employees, reflecting the importance given by SMEs to the tacit nature of knowledge which helps them in efficiency improvements, strategic adaptation, and the launch of new products and services. Our study contributes to advancing theory in the fields of knowledge management and absorptive capacity. We combine and extend previous research which allows us to reconcile the sometimes contradictory findings concerning knowledge management practices which SMEs can adopt to reinforce absorptive capacity.

First, it seeks to build an integrated model that can analyze the path through which headquarters, subsidiary competence, and knowledge transfer performance influence subsidiary performance. Second, it analyzes the influence of the specificity of technology as a moderating effect factor on knowledge transfer process. Third, it will conduct an empirical analysis on distributive manufacturing MNEs and suggests an implication for companies that actually need technological localization. The difference of this study are as follows. First, unlike the existing studies, this study can expand a theoretical discussion as it uses subsidiary performance as the dependent variable. Second, it sets the specificity of technology as a moderating effect factor, not an antecedent, and can draw a theoretical implication. Research design, data, and methodology - This study built a path analysis model to identify the influence of the disseminative capacity and absorptive capacity of distributive manufacturing MNEs on subsidiary performance. Based on the previous studies, it set 19 items as 5 latent variables, and established 6 hypotheses by including the moderating effect of the specificity of technology between them. The final 203 companies were selected as analysis samples through a survey questionnaire. For empirical analysis, the study used PLS (Partial Least Square) that is based on structural equation model. Results - The empirical analysis result demonstrated that both headquarters' disseminative capability and subsidiaries absorptive capacity had a positive influence on knowledge transfer performance. Knowledge transfer performance also had a positive influence on subsidiary performance. In the analysis of moderating effect, the specificity of technology acted as a significant moderating variable only between knowledge transfer performance and subsidiary performance; it did not show a statistically significant moderating effect among disseminative capability, absorptive capacity, and knowledge transfer performance. Conclusions - The empirical analysis results of this study demonstrate the importance of disseminative capability and absorptive capacity in knowledge transfer to subsidiaries from the distributive manufacturing MNEs in Korea. The analysis on the moderating effect indicates that the specificity of technology in Korean companies influences on the process of making achievement by using the transferred knowledge."

The relationship between the proportion of independent board members on the board and innovation performance is positively moderated by technology diversity strategy, whereas the focal link is negatively moderated by absorptive capacity. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how the fit relationships of governance arrangements (foreign ownership and independent board members) with internal conditions (technology diversity strategy and absorptive capacity) influence firms' ability to benefit from innovation activities.

During the past two decades, however, the industry's pipeline productivity has decreased compromising the industry's ability to meet shareholder expectations. As a strategy to invigorate pipeline productivity, and impact financial performance, pharmaceutical firms have increased utilization of strategic technical alliances. Earlier research shows that the degree of financial impact resulting from strategic technical alliances varies in terms of partnership type and differences between client and partner firms. This research studies strategic technical alliances between pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms from 1985 to 2012. Event study methodology is used to determine the relationship between stock market response to alliance announcements, measured as cumulative abnormal returns, and factors representing the absorptive capacity of the pharmaceutical firms in the sample. Then, variables indicating the development stage of the drugs included in the alliances are added to assess the effect of project risk on the market response. The study finds that, in general, the stock market responds in a positive manner to strategic technical alliances in the pharmaceutical industry reflecting the market's immediate response, and expectations of future firm value, resulting from the alliance. The degree of the market's response varies in terms of the client firms’ absorptive capacity with new product introductions being the strongest driver. The market responds similarly to alliances across different drug development stages, however, a stronger response is observed in preclinical and extension stages. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association"

The empirical findings suggest that corporate diversification reduces shareholders' wealth. However, consistent with the absorptive capacity viewpoint of organizational learning, diversification performance depends on repetitive and accumulative experiences that relate to a firm's prior diversification activity and/or a firm's experience in operating in multiple-business segments. Specifically, single-business firms that diversify once demonstrate significant value reduction. In contrast, multi-business firms that diversify once do not demonstrate value reduction, while single/multi-business firms that diversify multiple times demonstrate value creation. Findings also reveal that performance is conditional on the mode of diversification since internal growth diversification shows higher valuation effects than diversifications through acquisitions. These findings contribute to the literature by affirming the importance of organizational learning, a cognitive and behavioral perspective, in explaining the valuation effect of corporate diversification. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The focus is upon subsidiaries in developing countries, here Mozambique. More specifically, the article is concerned with identifying factors that influence the learning of internal stakeholders and noting practices which seem associated with a high level of absorptive capacity and performance of subsidiaries. The starting point is evidence of ineffective transfer of knowledge by MNCs to their subsidiaries in developing countries, with consequent sub-standard performance. The research reported involves four case studies of Portuguese companies operating in Mozambique and draws on data from interviews with senior and middle managers in the firms’ Mozambican subsidiaries. The results obtained suggest that successful knowledge transfer to overseas subsidiaries is found under the following conditions. First, the parent company knows the local context and provides a flow of relevant information. Second, application of knowledge locally is done flexibly to suit local circumstances. Next, a participatory approach is used so that local staff can see why the knowledge conveyed is necessary. Fourth, explanation and demonstration are key techniques, with major roles for on-the-job training, continuous improvement and training at headquarters.

This article examines three salient “origins” of reverse technology transfer—headquarters, local constituents, and subsidiary research and development (R&D) activity—and their impact on MNCs’ home-country product development. We argue that reverse technology transfer from subsidiary R&D activity is more likely to have a positive impact on MNC home-country product development than the other two origins because reverse transfer from local constituents requires high integration cost, and transfer from headquarters adds little technological novelty. We also develop two contingency hypotheses for the latter two origins to increase their likelihood of positive impacts on home-country product development. Using a data set of 1,331 Taiwanese MNCs, our empirical evidence provides two important messages to managers: (1) a subsidiary whose technology mainly relies on its R&D would be an ideal target for reverse transfer; and (2) reverse transfer from local constituents and headquarters can be effective when they fit with an appropriate organizational mechanism, such as governance mode and absorptive capacity. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Our findings suggest that the variable R&D subsidy is endogenous, significant, and has a strong positive influence on R&D cooperation. This is a clear indication that the achievement of public aid is often conditioned by the obligation for companies to cooperate in R&D. We have also found that the differentiation strategy variable is significant and has a negative influence on R&D cooperation. Companies positioned in a differentiation strategy probably own and use some different knowledge from other companies. Consequently, they will not have much interest in taking advantage of the spillovers generated by other companies. It is therefore logical that they are reluctant to establish cooperation agreements on R&D. Therefore, companies positioned in the differentiation strategy need public policies to support R&D that are not conditioned to the establishment of cooperation agreements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Exactly how openness influences enterprises' ability to innovate and benefit from external sources of innovation is not well understood. Despite theoretical models explicating knowledge inflows as the antecedent and innovation as the consequence of absorptive capacity, to date, the relationships between external knowledge inflows from specific external actors, absorptive capacity, innovation and SME performance remain underexplored. We address this gap, focussing on market- and science-based knowledge flows, absorptive capacity, innovation and SME performance. Using structural equation modelling on a sample of 838 Australians SMEs, we find evidence indicating that the mechanisms by which external knowledge inflows from market- and science-based actors affect innovation differ: external knowledge inflows from market-based actors influence innovation directly or ""serendipitously"", while external knowledge inflows from science-based actors influence innovation indirectly via absorptive capacity. We also find that their effect on innovation differ, with external knowledge inflows from market-based actors exerting a positive direct effect on innovation vis-à-vis external knowledge inflows from science-based actors where there is no significant direct effect. In contrast, external knowledge inflows from science-based actors influence innovation through absorptive capacity. In addition to this mediation effect, absorptive capacity has a positive direct effect on innovation, and an effect on firm performance through innovation. This research contributes to our understanding of how, and the extent to which, external knowledge inflows from specific external actors influence absorptive capacity, innovation and firm performance in SMEs. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."

Results of an analysis of a sample of 467 Spanish manufacturing firms reveal that openness of external knowledge search contributes to firms' exploratory, transformative and exploitative learning processes in different ways. In particular, a strong curvilinear effect of external knowledge search breadth on exploratory and exploitative learning was found. It is also important to establish deep relationships with external agents to achieve transformative and exploitative learning up to a certain point after which relationships become negative. Interestingly, for a firm to develop explorative learning, it is not important to establish deep relationships. And for a firm to develop transformative learning it is not important to establish broad relationships. Some suggestions for managers and future lines of research are provided. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a novel dataset supplied by the Italian Bureau of Statistics, we highlight that, when controlling for internal R&D efforts, not all firms are equally prone to gain access to external technology, and to the knowledge provided by universities in particular. We find that firms which do not only perform R&D activities but also belong to a group exhibit a higher propensity to access external knowledge by either contracting out R&D or cooperating with external parties, as compared to independent firms that are not organized into groups. This premium persists when controlling for different measures of internal R&D efforts. Furthermore, the differential in the propensity to access external knowledge is particularly high in the case of R&D performers belonging to foreign groups, i.e. Italian affiliates of foreign owned companies; and it is even higher in the case of the few Italian firms that have R&D activities abroad. The relative dis-advantage of independent firms, which represent the bulk of the Italian industry and include most small and medium sized enterprises, appears to be less of an obstacle in the case of linkages with universities, especially when R&D contracting out is considered. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

This paper presents an empirical analysis of the factors that affect the importance of academic knowledge for firms’ innovation activities. An integrated approach that simultaneously considers country- and firm-level factors is adopted. Regarding the former factors, the analysis shows that the entrepreneurial orientation of university and the quality of academic research increase the importance of knowledge transfers from universities to firms. This suggests that the environmental and institutional context contributes to cross-national disparities in university-industry interactions and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. In regard to the latter factors, the results indicate that firms oriented toward open search strategies and radical innovations are more likely to draw knowledge from universities. Furthermore, firms belonging to high technology sectors and firms with high absorptive capacity place greater value on the various links with universities. With respect to firm size, the estimates show an inverted U-shaped relation with the importance of universities as a source of knowledge. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The purpose of this paper is to derive insights from the absorptive capacity and contingency perspectives to introduce extra-organizational advice as a moderator of the relationship between EO and firm performance in a dynamic environment. Design/methodology/approach – Using survey data from 340 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana, the study examines the moderating influence of extra-organizational advice on the EO-firm performance relationship in dynamic environments. Findings – The study’s empirical findings suggest that extra-organizational advice amplifies the EO-performance relationship in dynamic environments. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design of the study does not permit causal inferences to be made regarding the variables examined. Future studies may use longitudinal design to examine the causal links of the variables. Limitations aside, the study helps to answer how extra-organizational advice translates EO into improved performance in an environment characterized by constant flux. Practical implications – The results of this paper can assist entrepreneurs and policy makers in understanding the dynamics and processes involved in implementing a strategic orientation to achieve higher performance. For SME managers, firm performance is determined by high levels of EO and extra-organizational advice in dynamic environments. The understanding of this issue can promote the development and maintenance of entrepreneurial ventures. Originality/value – The paper examines an important, but under-researched issue – the moderating effect of extra-organizational advice on the EO-performance relationship in dynamic environments.

Yet, transitioning between these orthogonal types of R&D is considered profound organizational change. Building on recent research showing that compact, significant changes in R&D expenditure is an antecedent to the transition between explorative and exploitative R&D, I show that this leap between exploration and exploitation is quite hazardous. The magnitude of changes in R&D expenditure, whether increases or decreases, is positively associated with organizational failure. Firms maintaining higher levels of absorptive capacity are more capable of surviving the leap from R&D-based exploitation to exploration, and firms that do not use reductions in R&D expenditure to manipulate short-term earnings performance are more likely to survive the leap from exploration to exploitation. Managerial summary: In order to survive and thrive, innovative companies must be able to exploit their existing competencies, and to explore for new ones once those current competencies decline in value. However, transiting from one form of innovation to the other is difficult because the skills required to explore are fundamentally opposed to those required to exploit. In this article, I describe how difficult this leap between exploration and exploitation can be. I show that the move between R&D-based exploration and exploitation is related to organizational failure. In addition, firms that are superior learners are more likely to survive the leap from exploitation to exploration, and firms that are not cutting R&D expenditure to manipulate earnings are more likely to survive the leap from exploration to exploitation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Implementing sustainability in small and medium-sized construction firms the role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978153844&doi=10.1108%2fECAM-01-2015-0015&partnerID=40&md5=cd8a649a8174ab10e8237eab2760b98d","Purpose - Construction organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the impacts of their operations, from both an environmental and, more recently, a social viewpoint. Sustainability standards can enable an organisation to evidence a benchmarked level of performance against a particular issue. To date, research on standards has largely focused on the operational and administrative aspects of their enactment, rather than how they might affect - and be appropriated by - organisational actors. The purpose of this paper is to examine how capacity for learning can affect the success of implementing standards within two construction SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - Taking an organisational learning and absorptive capacity (ACAP) perspective, this research uses the case study approach and abductive logic to understand what role learning plays with regard to sustainability standard implementation. Findings - The results reveal that strong communication channels and commitment to training programmes increase the capacity for implementing standards, but that SMEs tend only to approach standards if they see immediate financial benefits stemming from their implementation. Practical implications - SMEs provide a challenging context for the implementation of sustainability standards unless there are significant external levers and extrinsic motivation for them to be embraced. Care should be taken in incorporating these aspects into the future design of standards that are more aligned with SME needs. Social implications - Stakeholders should seek to apply pressure to firms to positively influence engagement with sustainability standards. Originality/value - The role and importance of ACAP is an underdeveloped debate in the certification field. This study is the first that links the process of implementing a standard with the ACAP of an organisation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"The impact of social capital on competitive advantage: The mediating effects of collective learning and absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976439370&doi=10.1108%2fMD-11-2015-0485&partnerID=40&md5=742a5d1e7464eb0386384ed51769edd4","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the influence of social capital on competitive advantage through collective learning and absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach – The study carries out analyses based on structural equation modeling to measure the main constructs and test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The primary statistical technique for assessing survey data collected from 358 Taiwan tenants is partial least squares analysis. Findings – Collective learning and absorptive capacity fully mediate the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage. Moreover, social capital has a significant influence on both collective learning and absorptive capacity. Practical implications – Tenant firms in industrial parks must develop effective management tactics for the nurturing of inter-firm relations to enhance collective learning and their absorptive capacity to acquire and exploit key strategic resources such as tacit and explicit knowledge. For specialized firms, close social interactions in specific contexts, mediated by collective learning and absorptive capacity to make up for their resource constraints, can heighten their competitive advantage. Originality/value – By demonstrating the impact of social capital on competitive advantage in the specific context of industrial parks, whose artificial environment encourages and promotes close social interactions among tenants, this paper overcomes previous and contradictory findings regarding the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage. A key contingent factor is the mediating role of collective learning and absorptive capacity. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach-The context for the research hypotheses is the Spanish banking industry. The authors conducted a study including 76 banks and 1,832 customers of these banks. This paper uses the partial least squares method to conduct the data analysis. Findings-The authors find support for all the hypotheses proposed in the model. The results show that service firms that are able to apply more knowledge or apply knowledge more effectively are likely to generate more benefits for their customers, and/or reduce their sacrifices, contributing significantly to a higher perception of service value. Research limitations/implications-The study focusses on one particular industry in a single point in time. A longitudinal analysis of a variety of service industries would enrich the study. Practical implications-It is argued that KM constitutes a key capability for service firms for the delivery of service value. According to the research, if service firms want to improve the application of knowledge, it is important to focus on knowledge retention while they create new knowledge. Originality/value-Although a considerable amount of research has been carried out in the fields of KM and customer value, there has been less research that has taken both into consideration simultaneously.

Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study has drawn on the data collected in an industrial cluster located in the Valencian Community in Spain. This population of firms allowed us to test various roles played by network endogenous forces, absorptive capacity and former performance in the creation and dissolution of inter-organisational linkages. The authors followed an evolutionary approach and applied network analysis techniques. Findings – Empirical evidences suggest that absorptive capacity and previous innovative performance are predictors of inter-business relationships. Absorptive capacity affects the emergence of linkages in the technological network, due to the tacit nature of technological knowledge. On the other hand, previous innovative performance is an indicator to identify leaders companies. These companies tend to increase the reception of request for advice from local firms. Moreover, prestigious companies tend to be more selective in choosing collaborators. Practical implications – This study helps researchers and managers better understand network dynamics. The generation of inter-organisational relationships in clusters can be determined by cognitive proximity and prestigious status in the network. These evidences are relevant in a mature cluster where knowledge is asymmetrically distributed. Originality/value – Over the last few decades, studies on industrial clusters have evolved from the “canonical” standpoint. Nowadays, researchers usually take a more sophisticated and richer view of this reality, mainly as a consequence of the inclusion the proximity concept, intra-cluster heterogeneity and advanced analysis of overlapping between networks and territory. Thus, the authors try to add some empirical evidence along these lines. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach – Subsidiary-level information is gathered using the sixth round of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey, thus including 507 subsidiaries from 22 countries. Country context is operationalised using the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum. Findings – The findings reveal that internal integration has a positive influence on operational performance improvement. Country context acts as a moderator on this relationship: subsidiaries in less developed countries are only able to improve their effectiveness (quality, flexibility, delivery), while developed country subsidiaries gain both effectiveness and efficiency (cost, time) benefits from internal integration. Research limitations/implications – The unit of analysis is the knowledge-receiving subsidiary without taking the characteristics of the sending unit or that of the whole network of subsidiaries into account. Based on the context-dependency of the integration-performance relationship found in this paper, a future research agenda is proposed including further factors (absorptive capacity, knowledge complementarity, organisational practices) that could influence this relationship. Practical implications – Subsidiary managers in less developed countries should strive to acquire intra-network knowledge related to effectiveness, while managers in developed countries can expect both efficiency and effectiveness benefits. Originality/value – A large-scale survey encompassing subsidiaries from both emerging and developed countries is used to offer deeper insight into the relationship between internal integration and performance. The paper provides a possible explanation for previous mixed findings on this relationship. The differentiation between efficiency and effectiveness performance shows that country context represents an important factor that moderates the integration-performance relationship. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, prior research often overlooks how absorptive capacity could increase a firm's costs associated with building this capacity, perpetuate and even increase inertia because of reduced variety and limited organisational search, handicap internal knowledge development, and complicate knowledge sharing. Research also ignores the growing complexity of absorptive capacity, a factor that could reduce a firm's gains from exploiting external knowledge. Our discussion builds on the knowledge-based view to provide an integrative framework for the performance effects of absorptive capacity. Based on different benefits and downsides of absorptive capacity at multiple levels of analysis, it points to an inverted U-shaped relationship between absorptive capacity and a firm's financial performance, highlighting several promising avenues for future research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis."

Surprisingly, such international licensing may be welfare-reducing if the difference in absorptive capacities between two licensees is large enough. © 2016 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University."

The research collected primary data through surveys of 24 Brazilian pharmaceutical companies (classified into three categories: state-owned laboratories, private pharmaceutical companies, and start-ups), who answered a closed questionnaire about technological capabilities and learning strategies. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics regarding the type of organization, level of technological competence (basic, intermediate, and advanced), and the nature of technological competence (operational and innovative). The results show that private pharmaceutical companies have a greater capacity to absorb foreign technology due to their previous experience with incremental innovation. In contrast, the state-owned pharmaceutical laboratories lack technological competencies in production and research and development (R&D) and therefore must make veritable “technological leaps” to comply with the demands of Brazil’s Ministry of Health. The start-ups, however, although standing out in terms of the degree of novelty of their technological innovations, lack the complementary assets to exploit economically the results of their R&D and are dependent on local industry to bring new products to market. Regarding technological learning, which requires a more active strategic positioning by the firms, most organizations proved to be dependent on public policies to invest in technological capability building, focusing strictly on incorporating technology for drug production (except for some private pharmaceutical companies), without seeking to advance in technological innovations. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

A theoretical model supporting the hypothesized relationships is developed, and then research hypotheses are tested with a sample of 111 industrial organizations, using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that knowledge creation positively influences innovation and partially mediates the relationship between intra-firm knowledge sharing and innovation. Knowledge acquisition from external partners is not enough to promote innovation results but significantly reinforces absorptive capacity as well as knowledge sharing. Companies' absorptive capacity fosters the creation of knowledge, but does not significantly influence organizational innovation. The small sample size limits generalization of the present findings. Further research should explore the complementary role of knowledge creation and absorptive capacity in both small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies. Knowledge management practitioners should facilitate a knowledge sharing environment, where new ideas and solutions can be developed, and consequently innovation outcomes are likely to occur.

The use of cognitive consistency and sensemaking theory enables examination of how these contingent factors influence the learning processes of two construction industry design teams embedded within more permanent home-organizational structures. A number of practical ways arise by which firms can facilitate organizational learning through their interactions with network partners. Enhancement of learning in and between organizations occurs when members are cognizant of the means by which they connect within a network to create shared meanings, and the way in which they forge ties and share expertise in the learning process that they engage in. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

In technology-driven firms, there has been an explicit emphasis on appropriability through imitation deterrence and cumulative inventions that build on prior firm innovation. We introduce systematic empirical evidence for a third mechanism of appropriability namely, knowledge retrieval, which is defined as the re-absorption of previously spilled knowledge. We extend previous studies which consider technological complexity and organizational coupling as predictors of appropriability by examining their impact on knowledge retrieval. We find that technological complexity has a curvilinear relationship with retrieval while organizational coupling has a negative relationship. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of absorptive capacity, organizational design and appropriability of innovation. Managerial summary: It is a widely held assumption that knowledge should be protected and held tightly within the firm to ensure value creation and value capture. The implicit recognition is that knowledge spillovers, or knowledge leakage, is detrimental to performance. By examining the patterns of citations among patents of 142 semiconductor firms, we study how organizational structure and technological complexity play a role. We find that moderate technological complexity improves appropriability. If imitation deterrence is paramount, then the optimal structure would be a tightly-coupled organization. In other instances, loosely-coupled organizations may be superior because they foster internal cumulative innovations and, if spillovers were to occur, they also maximize knowledge retrieval. Our findings suggest that all is not lost when spillovers occur and that firms can continue to benefit in downstream innovations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This strategic approach is known as inbound open innovation. The existing empirical evidence regarding the impact of inbound open innovation on performance, however, is ambiguous. The equivocal results are due to moderating factors that influence a firm's ability to acquire technological knowledge from external sources and to transform it into innovation outputs. This paper focuses on a relevant yet overlooked category of moderating factors: organization of research and development (R&D). It explores two organizational mechanisms: one informal and external-oriented (involvement of external consultants in R&D activities) and one formalized and internal-oriented (existence of a dedicated R&D unit), in the acquisition of technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, a particular contractual form for inbound open innovation. Drawing on a capabilities perspective and using a longitudinal dataset of 841 Spanish manufacturing firms observed over the period 1999-2007, this paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the moderating effects of the two organizational mechanisms. The involvement of external consultants in R&D activities strengthens the impact of inbound open innovation on innovation performance by increasing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing. Moreover, it reduces the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. Instead, the existence of a dedicated R&D unit makes the firm less sensitive to changes in the level of inbound open innovation, by reducing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, and increases the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. The results regarding the role of informal and formalized R&D organizational mechanisms contribute to research on open innovation and absorptive capacity, and also inform managers as to what organizational mechanism is recommended to acquire external technological knowledge, depending on the objectives that the firm pursues. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association."

Findings: Firms increasingly establish innovation processes that involve an active acquisition of external technologies, often through alliances and licensing. To explain differences across firms in external knowledge acquisition, marketing and product innovation researchers have recently adopted a process perspective of absorptive capacity, which refers to a firm’s ability to explore, retain and exploit external knowledge. This paper develops a conceptual framework with propositions relating technology orientation, responsive market orientation and proactive market orientation to the three process stages of absorptive capacity under different conditions of environmental dynamism.

Design/methodology/approach – Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small- and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of open innovation and a company’s absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their open innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Findings – Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers). Research limitations/implications – Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 – 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrárgazdasági Kutatóintézet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper’s limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain). Practical implications – The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain’s enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of open innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems.

"The Impact of Virtual Customer Community Interactivity on Organizational Innovation: An Absorptive Capacity Perspective","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971513909&doi=10.1109%2fTPC.2016.2561118&partnerID=40&md5=cd58502564b032b8083a2522e8e45460","Research problem: Organizations are increasingly investing in virtual customer communities that reduce communication barriers between organizations and customers. However, little is known regarding how virtual customer communities might affect a firm's learning and innovation activities. Research question: What effects do virtual customer communities have on the relationship between absorptive capacity and organizational innovation? Literature review: Research has shown that virtual customer communities promote knowledge creation and knowledge sharing by facilitating communication within a virtual customer community. We investigate the extent to which interactivity in virtual customer communities influences the relationship between a firm's absorptive capacity (the ability to identify, assimilate, and apply external knowledge) and the extent to which a firm develops incremental and radical innovations. Methodology: We test this model with a quantitative survey-based research design that involves 102 firm-sponsored virtual customer communities. We use hierarchical regression techniques to test our hypotheses. Results: Absorptive capacity is positively related to incremental innovation and negatively related to radical innovation. Furthermore, virtual customer community interactivity moderates the relationship between absorptive capacity and incremental innovation. Conclusions: Virtual customer communities are transforming communication relationships between organizations and customers in ways that influence a firm's learning and innovation activities. One limitation of our study is the use of a single respondent for our survey. We recommend that future research examine how virtual customer communities affect organization-customer communication channels. © 1988-2012 IEEE."
"Mediation of Perceived Innovation Characteristics on ERP Adoption in Industrial Cluster","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964037952&doi=10.1142%2fS0219877016400034&partnerID=40&md5=9f6b587610e3d55e4434d8fb04525dce","An industrial cluster, due to its close network of institutions, will experience various pressures that force the industry to have a homogeneous structure, norms, and practices. These pressures can also lead to adoption of innovative technologies. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is perceived as a sophisticated technology and diffuses across the cluster by its innovative characteristics. However, firms in the industrial cluster will have different rate of adoption of technologies due to the varying level of knowledge spillover and a heterogeneous absorptive capacity. This study empirically tests how absorptive capacity mediates the institutional forces and the perceived innovation characteristics towards the ERP adoption in an industrial cluster. Mediation effect and the model validity are tested using SEM technique. The results show that absorptive capacity complements the forces of institutional pressure and the perceived innovation characteristics on ERP adoption. The implications of managing the absorptive capacity for better ERP adoption are discussed. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company."

This is the first study to integrate perspectives from contingency theory and the resource-based view of the firm to show how differences in resources and capabilities combined with the specific needs of the New Product and Process Development Projects, will influence the type of complementarity between product and process innovation. We develop a classification that defines seven unique complementarities between product and process innovation and illustrate them in a Product-Process Complementarity Map. This helps Product and Process Development Managers to visualize the variety of options companies have in their New Product and Process Development Projects. We advance our argument by identifying three contingency factors: Technology trajectories, power of supply chain, potential and realized absorptive capacity. These three discrete, but interrelated resources and capabilities are widely referenced in the context of process industries that are likely to lead to different complementarity types. Finally, these two contributions are brought together in The Complementarity-Capability Matrix, where we propose seven complementarity strategies and resources and capabilities necessary to achieve them. The matrix was designed to contribute to our understanding of complementarities beyond the industry and company level and serve as a useful tool in decision making for managers that are facing New Product and Process Development Projects. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – The research model and hypothesized relationships are empirically tested using the structural equation modelling approach, validated by factor analysis of 128 small medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK telecommunications sector. Findings – The findings suggest that, in order to achieve higher levels of RACAP, managers need to create and support a CL process. Furthermore, if an SME does not achieve the required RACAP then IOP is likely to deteriorate. Originality/value – SMEs need to provide and support a learning process, which is customized and based on three sub-processes: first, the framework for transferring knowledge; second, the framework for transforming knowledge; and third, an open organizational context. Based on these results, transferring and transforming are important sub-processes but are not sufficient for updating congenital knowledge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However several factors could constrain the acquisition of this knowledge by the local employees who are engaged in the former. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the underlying differences for the individual's knowledge acquisition capability. Design/methodology/approach - Individual's knowledge acquisition capability was conceptualized as the individual dimension of absorptive capacity (ACAP). Given the engagement of employees in joint project teams, the team members are expected to differ in their experience and disposition to task. Thus, these differences are considered as predictors of the local team members ACAP, i.e., abilities to: recognize the value of; and assimilate the external knowledge embedded in the foreign partners. The hypothesized model was validated through the results of structural equation modeling on a cross sectional survey of 248 local team members of joint projects in the Nigerian upstream oil industry. Findings - All the hypothesized relationships were supported, with the exception of that between prior experience and ability to recognize the value of knowledge. Originality/value - This study offers empirical clarification on the underlying differences for individual ACAP within the context of asymmetric joint project teams set up to facilitate knowledge transfer. The findings have implications for academic and practical understanding on the role of individuals in the acquisition of external knowledge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach – Based on the knowledge perspective of an M&A, this study measures how much of the target’s knowledge acquired in an M&A has been effectively transformed into new knowledge. A negative binomial regression on a cross-sectional data set of 152 bio-pharmaceutical firms (59 European firms and 93 North American firms) completing at least one M&A in the period between 2001 and 2005 is conducted. The effect of knowledge utilization is assessed by comparing performance six years before the M&A and six years after. Findings – The effective assimilation and utilization of acquired knowledge positively affects both acquirers’ explorative and exploitative performance post-M&As. The combined effect with technological relatedness, measured as similarity and complementarity, further enhances the acquirer’s technological performance. However, while the utilization of similar knowledge significantly affects only exploitative invention performance, the utilization of complementary knowledge influences both, although explorative more than exploitative performance. Originality/value – The acquirer’s ability to effectively use the target’s knowledge is crucial in order to support the transformation of the inventive potential, such as is embodied in the interaction between an internal and an external base of knowledge, into new explorative and exploitative performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The study takes into account the effects of the interaction between brokerage activities and the firm's absorptive capacity and extra-cluster openness, and evaluates synergies that derive from the simultaneous development of two different brokerage profiles. Comprehensive fieldwork in the Toy Valley cluster in the Valencia region (Spain) shows that intermediating between firms that are in different positions in the local value system unevenly affects the broker's innovation capability. Furthermore, for roles with a high effect on innovation, the broker's absorptive capacity and extra-cluster connections moderate network position effects. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

The results of structural equation modeling analysis suggest that absorptive capacity has a direct effect on climate change innovations, and stimulates knowledge exchanges (KEs) between firms in the cluster. KEs between firms in the cluster in turn directly affect the climate change innovations. The findings suggest a perhaps counterintuitive interrelationship between firm- and cluster-level impacts, in which KEs between firms in the cluster play a partial mediating role in the innovation process. The study further finds that climate change innovations are related to firm performance (FP) and reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs): mitigative innovations lead to greater GHG reductions while adaptive innovations impact on FP.

Engineering specific IT-tools (CAx, PDM) support specific steps of the engineering process, but advances towards more holistic collaborative working environments that support coordination and communication requirements in addition to engineering work have been meagre. I argue that missing absorptive capacity and collaboration between different innovation stakeholders (users, technology providers, and researchers) is a key reason for this. A living lab approach orchestrating different knowledge building, idea generation, and experimentation activities has the potential to drive innovation in this domain. The paper introduces the different methodologies and discusses their practical application in a case example.

In related business management literature, shifts from 'closed' to 'open' models are argued to be triggered by new technological, economic and social trends so that many organisations (at least partially) virtualise, their members being distributed across different locations and embedded in various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Complementing that line of argument, the current paper undertakes socio-systems-theoretical revisits to key institutional premises assumed in concepts above - organisation, knowledge, collaboration, complexity etc. - to examine, explore and restate in which sense 'openness' may be feasible in organisational realm and with what respects 'open innovation' may be supported, accordingly. It is argued that, rather than requiring to tear down organisational walls 'outwards' (which in principle is not possible), 'open innovation' enables, and is enabled by, differentiating organisations 'inwards' to better turn 'irritations' feared into chances recognised to leverage upon. © 2008 Nottingham University."

Focussing on one form of institutional changes, namely pro-market reforms, the paper analyzes how firms may boost the potential benefits from such changes through international strategies that increase their access to knowledge spillovers and absorptive capacity. These strategies include international product diversification, enhancing innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge. Design/methodology/approach – The hypotheses are tested using generalized least squares models with AR(1) panel-specific autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity correction. Based on the preliminary analyses performed in these studies, the author also executes a Hausman test, Bartlett’s test, and James/Alexander’s test. The results of these analyses indicate that the use of random effects is appropriate; that moderating effects are present; and that multivariate analyses using these moderators are suitable, respectively. Findings – The results indicate that pro-market reforms have a positive and significant effect on the profitability of firms from developing countries. Furthermore, they provide support for the positive moderating effects of international product diversification, innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge. Together, these findings suggest that through their international strategic decisions, MNEs can enhance their access to knowledge and become more responsive to institutional changes in their home market. Research limitations/implications – This paper contributes to the economic geography literature by linking the POST Model with the classification of types of knowledge from Learning Theory. The paper analyzes how characteristics of place, organization, space, and time play a different role for each of the three basic types of knowledge that is relevant for international firms: institutional, business, and internationalization. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the literature on reforms and firm profitability by delving deeper into the moderating effect of strategic decisions on the relationship between reforms and firm performance. This allows us to have a deeper comprehension of how various sources of international learning may enhance the responsiveness of firms to institutional changes. Originality/value – The paper provides several important contributions to the international strategy literature. First, it contributes to Learning Theory by combining it with the POST Model of Economic Geography to study how each of the three sources of knowledge (and their subcomponents) can be further broken down into factors of place, organization, space, and time. Second, it contributes to the literature of institutional change by studying how knowledge acquired through vastly different means can provide firms with sources of competitive advantage over other local competitors when responding to institutional changes in their home market. Third, it contributes to the literature on reforms and profitability by studying five novel moderators of this relationship. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We propose that firms with the capacity to acquire and assimilate the knowledge provided by universities, mainly due to being academic spin-offs or having long-term relationships with them, receive more knowledge from universities. We also argue that firms located in central positions inside the local firm-network have access to a complementary source of technical knowledge. Empirical evidence gathered from the Madrid Science Park confirms that having long-term relationships with universities, based on both formal and informal interactions, is the most important means of obtaining technical knowledge from them. We also observed a positive relationship between the technological knowledge obtained from universities and the innovation carried out by firms. Finally, we confirmed that firms with a significant role as intermediaries between other co-located firms have a higher level of innovation even if they are not involved in relationships with the university. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It analyzes the cumulative abnormal return of cross border acquisitions of listed Indian firms in Europe focusing on acquirers' research intensity. The study discovers a U-shaped relationship between research intensity of Indian acquirers and their cumulative abnormal return following acquisitions in Europe. As such, firms with no research capacity can benefit from the acquisition by accessing advanced targets, although firms with extensive research capacity outperform any of their Indian competitors as these firms have the absorptive capacity to not only exploit but also explore the knowledge base of the acquired target. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the acquisition of a high-tech target company, regardless of the absorptive capacity of the acquirer. We also found that business group membership has a positive impact on shareholder value, although horizontal acquisitions as compared to vertical and unrelated deals have a significantly negative impact for these companies. This result is again linked to the more explorative nature of vertical and unrelated acquisitions in comparison with horizontal deals that are more based on the exploitation of existing resources and capabilities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."
"Linking technological and educational level diversities to innovation performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928742603&doi=10.1007%2fs10961-015-9413-z&partnerID=40&md5=8cffb0922448e8aea4265151efd935bf","In this study, we explore the extent to which diversity of educational levels among research scientists and engineers (RSEs) in the context of a firm’s level of technological diversity influences innovation performance. We used data from the 2004–2008 National R&D Survey in Singapore. The results from 366 firms across different industries indicate that when a firm’s technological domains are heterogeneous, those firms with an RSE workforce comprising similar educational levels have positive innovation performance, measured as the number of patent applications, while those comprising diverse educational levels have negative innovation performance. Our further exploration of the positive interaction between technological domain heterogeneity and similarity of educational levels suggests that firms that had a high ratio of RSEs with lower educational levels had more positive patent outcomes compared to those that had a high ratio of RSEs with higher educational levels. The results show that there are limits to the strength of technological diversity in a firm’s absorptive capacity as explained by organizational demography. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

A sample of 367 cross-border mergers and acquisitions between 2000 and 2011 involving Chinese listed companies as the acquirers was analyzed to highlight the relationship between the cultural distance involved and the acquirers' market valuation. On average, such cross-border transactions created value for the acquirer's shareholders, but cultural distance was negatively related to the extent of such value creation. Larger firms, more experienced firms, and acquisitions within the same industry were found to be less affected by cultural distance, emphasizing the importance of learning and absorptive capability, but employing a financial advisor did not seem to help. Thus firms with greater absorptive capacity were found better able to overcome the difficulties caused by cultural differences.

In this paper we calculate the DC distribution network line loss and the voltage unbalanced distribution by DC flow calculation analysis under different topologies. According to the simulation results of steady state power flow of DC power distribution network, we analysis the influence of the distributed generations and network structure on the voltage distribution and network loss. The results show that the structure of the DC distribution network directly affects the network loss and the unbalance of voltage distribution, and the mesh structure can improve the absorptive capacity of the distributed generations. Access points' numbers and capacity of DGs can also influence both of network loss and unbalance voltage distribution. © 2015 IEEE."

Acquiring and sharing sustainability knowledge with suppliers have been identified as critical success factors of SSM. The purpose of this paper is to identify the mechanisms that allow firms to effectively acquire and share sustainability-related knowledge with suppliers and how these knowledge generation and desorption mechanisms support the evolution of firm SSM capabilities. Design/methodology/approach – To address the research purpose, four longitudinal case studies, two industry leaders in SSM and two industry followers, were conducted at multiple consecutive points in time between 2008 and 2013. Findings – The results indicate which mechanisms constitute a sustainability-related absorptive and desorptive capacity and how they support SSM. Thereby, this research explains which mechanisms support firms to acquire sustainability knowledge, assimilate and exploit it and also share it with their suppliers over time. Research limitations/implications – This research sheds light on the development and refinement of SSM capabilities by studying the explorative and exploitative learning cycles within focal buying firms taking place over time. Findings indicate a multiplicity in applying absorptive capacity- and desorptive capacity-related mechanisms yields an ambidextrous ability to simultaneously exploit existing knowledge through incremental SSM improvements and explore new SSM knowledge for more radical refinements of SSM capabilities. Practical implications – The results provide a blueprint for firms, especially for sustainability followers, seeking to develop effective SSM capabilities. Furthermore, the results explain which mechanisms support firms to acquire, assimilate and exploit sustainability knowledge and also to share it with their suppliers. Originality/value – SSM knowledge acquisition, assimilation, exploitation and sharing takes place over time in focal buying firms. This ongoing process helps explain how an SSM capability development and refinement is manifested in both leaders and followers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"Using external knowledge to improve organizational innovativeness: understanding the knowledge leveraging process","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960347623&doi=10.1108%2fJBIM-04-2014-0064&partnerID=40&md5=800d0c3b754e87476b22979d8a026aa9","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the process used by organizations to leverage external knowledge. A model of the knowledge leveraging process is developed, which hypothesizes joint sensemaking is a key antecedent to both explicit and tacit knowledge exchange, a dual role for explicit knowledge exchange (i.e. as an antecedent of both tacit knowledge exchange and absorptive capacity) and absorptive capacity is a key mediator between knowledge exchange (both explicit and tacit) and organizational innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach – The hypothesized model is tested using survey data gathered from over 230 Chinese companies. The results from the analysis of the hypothesized model are compared to ones from a theory-based rival model. The analyses are performed using partial least squares analysis. Findings – The results suggest key roles for both joint sensemaking and absorptive capacity in the knowledge exchange process. In addition, our findings provide evidence regarding the interplay between explicit and tacit knowledge exchange and their role in the knowledge leveraging process. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional nature of the study provides limited inferences regarding causality. In addition, organizational innovativeness is measured using self-reported, subjective assessments. However, the results provide valuable insights into the knowledge leveraging process. Practical implications – The study increases our understanding of how organizations leverage external knowledge to improve organizational innovativeness. In addition, it provides specific guidance for managers interested in leveraging external knowledge. Originality/value – Knowledge and knowledge management issues are receiving increased attention in the marketing literature. However, due to the complexity involved in transferring and using external knowledge, our understanding of the processes involved is limited. Our study provides some insights regarding how firms leverage external knowledge and therefore should be of interest to both researchers and practitioners. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Findings – Knowledge sharing in the organization has a great potential to foster competency development and generate a sense of affective commitment and intention to stay of employees of Gen Y. Research limitations/implications – A conceptual framework of knowledge sharing for competency development could assist HR managers in fine-tuning their retention strategy for Gen Y employees. The future work should carry out the empirical validation of the suggested conceptual framework. Practical implications – Organizations should focus on knowledge sharing to enhance absorptive capacity, which fosters competency development. The framework suggests an approach of generation-specific retention strategy.

This study develops and tests a theoretical model that leverages the individual-level knowledge-based view perspective to understand the process through which risk mitigation orientation of the supply chain manager contributes to his/her absorptive capacity. A supply chain managers absorptive capacity, in turn, enhances his/her ability to effectively mitigate supply chain risk. Study findings demonstrate that supply chain managers with high-risk mitigation orientation have greater level of absorptive capacity which enhances their risk mitigation competency. This study represents the first development and testing of a model that examines individual-level knowledge management factors that affect supply chain risk mitigation competency. This research emphasises the importance of the individual supply chain manager in managing risk and illustrates how theoretical perspectives from the knowledge management, supply chain risk and organisational behaviour literature can be fruitfully adopted to explain behaviour in the field of supply chain risk management. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

Conventionally, internal R&D expenditure is used as a proxy for absorptive capacity, but in the context of open innovation, this can be problematic. Internal R&D may also constrain present and future absorption, and restrict exploitation for a number of reasons, e.g. degree of development, structural, geographical or relevance to existing business units and markets. Conversely, external sources of innovation can be difficult to identify, evaluate and absorb, but may be more codified, as by definition they are available in the market, and more fully-developed to demonstrate commercial potential. Using panel data of 325 firms over five years, we find that contrary to the prescriptions of transaction cost analysis, externally-sourced knowledge takes less time to absorb and exploit than internally-generated knowledge, but that internal knowledge creates higher returns over the longer term. Significantly, the relationship between internal and external knowledge and performance changes over time, while the ideal strategic balance needs to consider decisions taken at different times. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

The aim of this article is to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse quadruple helix stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional quadruple helix stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Some studies show that each alliance partner type has different alliance motives, resources and capabilities, organizational structures and cultures, and degrees of competition with partners, which can lead to different performances of strategic alliances. In this regard, this study conducts an empirical analysis of the different impact of each type of alliance partner on technological innovation performance and finds the moderating effect of absorptive capacity and potential competition by categorizing strategic alliances for R&D activities in the biotechnology industry into three types: vertical-downstream alliances, vertical-upstream alliances, and horizontal alliances. This study analyzed 206 Korean biotechnology firms and their strategic alliances for a total of 292 R&D activities. The results of the analysis showed that vertical alliances have a positive impact on technological innovation performance, while horizontal alliances have an inverted U-shaped relationship with technological innovation performance caused by the effect of competition. Additionally, it was confirmed that the R&D intensity of biotechnology firms has a moderating effect of increasing the impact of vertical-upstream alliances on technological innovation performance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Whereas existing research emphasizes the importance of interfirm collaboration engagement to realize synergistic benefits in interfirm NPD projects, it remains surprisingly silent on the potential impact of intrafirm relational processes and how they can impact the interfirm setting. In this article, we therefore explore the impact of intrafirm collaboration engagement on the relationship between interfirm collaboration engagement and new product development (NPD) performance in interfirm NPD projects. Relying on insights from information processing theory, the authors hypothesize that intrafirm collaboration engagement increases firms' capacity to process complex information flows in the case of extensive interfirm collaboration engagement. Moreover, it is expect that the added value of extensive intrafirm collaboration engagement depends on the innovation objective (i.e., incremental versus radical new product development) of the interfirm NPD project. In particular, we hypothesize that the positive moderating impact of intrafirm collaboration engagement on the relationship between interfirm collaboration engagement and NPD performance is stronger for radical interfirm projects than incremental interfirm projects. Analyzing 195 interfirm NPD projects, a negative interaction effect between interfirm and intrafirm collaboration engagement is observed in radical interfirm NPD projects, whereas significant interactions between them remain absent in incremental interfirm NPD projects. Jointly, these findings provide first evidence that intrafirm relational processes can substantially impact partners' ability to realize relational rents in interfirm settings. Moreover, the negative interaction effect between interfirm and intrafirm collaboration engagement points to potential trade-offs between inward-looking and outward-looking absorptive capacity. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association."

Thick contracts include a clause specifying that the licensors are obligated to assist the licensees in assimilating and integrating the technology. Drawing on a sample of 133 licensees and an equal number of matched nonlicensees, we present empirical evidence that thick contracts propel the licensees' likelihood of introducing new inventions. It is also found that thick contracts act as a substitute for licensees' absorptive capacity. Licensees that are more familiar with the licensed technology are in less need of assistance from the licensors to assimilate and integrate the knowledge. However, this substitution effect is neutralized once the hurdle of invention has been overcome, meaning that the licensees have succeeded to ignite the invention process, suggesting the exploitation of the learning curve, triggered by their mutual understanding. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative methodology is adopted to examine the proposed relationship between interorganizational knowledge sharing, absorptive capacity and organizational performance. The study uses survey data from 269 companies in Brazil. Structural equation modeling is applied to test the stated hypotheses and the model. Findings – The empirical findings indicate that interorganizational knowledge sharing is composed of the donation and collection of knowledge. Interorganizational knowledge collection is found to have a positive effect on interorganizational knowledge donation, while collection is found to have a positive effect, mediated by absorptive capacity, on organizational performance. Research limitations/implications – One limitation of this research was the predominant participation of smaller companies. Another is that the data were only collected from Brazilian companies. Moreover, an instrument to measure these constructs was proposed and validated to enable future research to be conducted into the process of interorganizational knowledge sharing and its components: knowledge donation and knowledge collection. Practical implications – Managers can enhance organizational performance by developing both the donation and collection of knowledge. Knowledge donation is particularly important because, in addition to its impact on absorptive capacity and organizational performance, it contributes to the development of knowledge collection, which is also indirectly related to performance. Originality value – The donation and collection of knowledge were validated as components of the interorganizational knowledge-sharing process, and the relationship between these processes and organizational performance is mediated by the absorptive capacity of the organization. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The few existing works present absorptive capacity as an essentially linear process, and the way the different phases of this process are actually carried out remains understudied. In order to enhance our understanding of the way firms absorb external knowledge, we gathered data from 23 interviews of managers from three different industrial firms. Our results suggest that, far from being linear, the process displays several feedback loops, both within and between each phase of absorption.

The horizontal dimension refers to a dynamic interplay between internal and external environments of the firm, which is extensively covered in the absorptive capacity research. However, the literature ignores vertical dimension involving individual-organization interactions. Scant knowledge is available about the mechanisms through which absorptive capacity emerges as an organizational learning capability. This study reviews the seminal works of Cohen and Levinthal and finds that the stickiness of knowledge, the multiple antecedents of absorptive capacity and their interactions are explicitly addressed therein, but are insufficiently problematized in subsequent research. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and the micro-foundations lens of organizational capabilities, the present study re-conceptualizes absorptive capacity as a set of three sequentially linked learning processes where individual and organizational antecedents interact, and explains how value recognition, assimilation and application capabilities emerge as organizational (macro) level phenomena. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

We address this fundamental issue in a novel way by developing an integrative framework of absorptive capacity (AC) and inbound open innovation that is rooted in the attention-based view of the firm. We specifically address why a balance between open and closed innovation is important from the perspective of absorptive capacity, and show how it may be brought about. Pursuing either open or closed inbound innovation alone may result in an imbalance between potential AC and realized AC as well as inward-looking AC and outward-looking AC, which will hinder innovative performance. We argue that practicing open and closed inbound innovation repeatedly and alternately by switching organizational attentions, and thus developing the associated AC, can facilitate balancing absorptive capacity and lead to innovative performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."
"Direct and mediated ties to universities: “Scientific” absorptive capacity and innovation performance of pharmaceutical firms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957799166&doi=10.1177%2f1476127015604734&partnerID=40&md5=3bf4b0a165cf669104822c3fc595cd0c","Extant literature on firm–university collaboration has emphasized two different strategies that firms in science-based industries adopt to source scientific knowledge and expertise. On one hand, firms engage in direct research collaborations with universities. On the other hand, firms establish indirect, mediated, ties to universities by engaging in research collaborations with dedicated biotech firms that are themselves strongly linked to universities—with the dedicated biotech firm taking the role of “broker.” We argue that the relative benefits of direct and mediated ties depend on the extent to which firms have organized their research and development to facilitate the absorption, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation of scientific knowledge, which we coin “scientific absorptive capacity.” Drawing on patent and publication data in a panel of 33 vertically integrated pharmaceutical firms, we find that direct university collaboration is more beneficial for firms with relatively high scientific absorptive capacity, while only mediated ties are associated with greater innovative performance for firms with relatively low scientific absorptive capacity. The latter association is reduced if the mediated ties are with top universities. Our findings are suggestive of the importance of a “fit” between the nature of a firm’s research and development organization and its strategy to access scientific knowledge. © The Author(s) 2015."

This question has become more important to manufacturing industries as environmental concerns are escalating, particularly in emerging economies. We examine the effects of green process innovation on the financial performance of manufacturing industries with a focus on the moderating effects of government subsidies versus industries' own absorptive capability. Using sulfur dioxide emissions as an environmental index, we establish a dynamic model using ten years panel data from 28 industries in China where environmental concerns have been severe and government subsidies have been commonly believed to be instrumental. The results show that clean technologies and end-of-pipe technologies are positively related to financial performance at the industry level, thus it pays to be 'green.' Furthermore, strong absorptive capacity tends to enhance this relationship, but surprisingly green subsidies turn out to weaken this relationship. We also find the effects are different between clean technologies and end-of-pile technologies, which leads to finer grained insights into these two types of technologies and their adoption. We conclude that manufacturing industries can benefit more from green process innovation by leveraging their internal absorptive capability, as opposed to replying on external government subsidies as commonly believed. Our findings provide finer grained insights on the benefits of green process innovation, and shed light on the study of green process innovation in other emerging economies. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

Firms see open innovation nowadays as an important capability to build and maintain innovativeness, even in dynamic global markets. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the question which factors determine successful innovation within the open innovation environment. In this regard, based on the dynamic capabilities view, we hypothesise that a firm's openness, its absorptive capacity and its flexibility primarily determine innovation success in in-bound open innovation environments. To test these hypotheses, we analyse a large scale survey sample of 496 German manufacturing companies from different industries by applying structural equation modelling. As a main result, we find evidence for a positive association between the three mentioned constructs and innovation success. © 2016 Imperial College Press."

While such stakeholder co-creation creates benefits for the focal firm such as access to unique resources and knowledge bases, it also raises new challenges because of the diverse characteristics, interests and goals of the different stakeholders involved. Specific capabilities to anticipate and manage these challenges are therefore of particular interest for research and practice. The study here narrows this gap by conducting an in-depth case study, examining multiple stakeholder co-creation projects embedded within a pharmaceutical firm. The study develops a contingency framework on the role of four stakeholder co-creation capabilities in generating valuable knowledge.

The findings indicate that relational capability facilitates sensing capability, absorptive capacity, and integrative capability. Further, all of these dynamic capabilities affect stages of the adoptive management innovation process; from initiation through to implementation. As innovation results can be intangible and lagging, and consequently difficult to measure, the method offers managers an alternative by monitoring the effects of different capabilities at each stage of the adoptive management innovation process. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

However there remains a gap in understanding how particular combinations of capabilities may give rise to different patterns of innovation adoption across firms in the tourism industry. The study addresses this gap by advancing insights on the capabilities of tourism accommodation establishments to adopt environmental technologies and measures in their maintenance and operational activities; and the extent to which tourism firms exploit their relation with a type of business partner (engineering consulting firms in this study) to appropriate knowledge about environmental innovations and build absorptive capacity. For this purpose, the research builds a qualitative study on the adoption of energy efficiency measures in hotels in Malta, a Mediterranean tourism destination. The findings demonstrate different patterns of innovation adoption amongst the firms in terms of the range of energy technologies and measures adopted that are contingent on the firms' particular combination of capabilities to solve problems around energy efficiency; and to accumulate knowledge about energy solutions through creating spaces for innovation adoption. Tourism firms that build internal capabilities for adoption of energy efficient measures and technologies are more likely to mobilize their relation with engineering firms in order to co-produce innovative energy efficient solutions. The policy implication is that policy measures should increasingly promote the development of capabilities for energy management alongside programmes that are focussed on the diffusion of environmental technologies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

For this purpose, we use two datasets of 8647 Italian service firms and 2500 Portuguese service firms that participated in the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), 2010. A logit analysis is conducted for 'KIS' and 'LKIS' firms and, the results reveal that for both KIS and LKIS service firms in Italy, absorptive capacity enablers, such as external R&D, internal R&D and employees expertise have a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. In addition, the establishment of coopetion relationships with Italian concurrent firms denotes a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. Furthermore, for the LKIS service Italian firms, the coopeting relations with rival firms located in China and India also denotes a positive and significant impact on product innovation. For the Portuguese KIS firms, we find out that the internal R&D activities and acquisition of external R&D have a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. In addition, the set of coopetition relationships with concurrent European firms also presents a positive and significant effect on the generation of product innovation. For the LKIS firms, the internal R&D and the external R&D also impact positively and in a significant way on the generation of innovation.

The per capita income convergence towards the major FDI home country, US, is estimated higher for Europe compared to the MENA region. However, the differences in the convergence values are not so wide between some sub-groups of these two regions. The absorptive capacity hypothesis, together with the investment capacity explains the discrepancies between not only the two regions as a whole, but also sub-groups within each region. The strong complementary effects between FDI and both absorptive and investment capacity suggest that economic policy aimed at fostering growth should try to benefit more from FDI by increasing the absorptive capacity-enhancing own R&D activities and promoting human capital- as well as by improving investment environment to attract more of it. © 2016, IGI Global.

We investigate the determinants of innovation creation through technological M&As. Based on the concept of relative absorptive capacity, the study examines how the acquiring firm absorbs and assimilates the knowledge of the acquired firm and creates innovation. Specifically, the technological M&As are examined by presenting dyadic perspective variables, including technological similarity and technological digestibility which affect the assimilation, transformation, and exploitation processes of the absorptive capacity. We additionally investigate the role of M&A experience as a moderator of dyadic characteristics and innovation performance of technological M&As. Two hundred and twelve cases of technological M&As in the biopharmaceutical industry from 1993 to 2007 are investigated using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and negative binomial regression. The findings confirm a positive effect of acquiring small firms having a modest level of similar knowledge on post-M&A innovation performance. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of the dyadic perspective in advancing the understanding of technological M&A. © 2016 Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME)."

However, these activities are dominated by big firms and big cities, spurring a large body of research into creative cities in the last decade. Going against this trend, this paper examines how small creative firms in small cities can successfully export their products. Drawing on survey data from 464 small firms in the creative industries in the county of Rogaland, Norway, it examines how cooperation with partners and active strategies for identifying and absorbing knowledge from these partners affect the firms' ability to sell their products abroad. Firms with extensive collegial linkages, especially those that cooperate with partners in the international artistic community, are particularly successful at exporting. However, cooperation within the national artistic community may have a negative effect on exporting. Furthermore, having strategies for absorbing knowledge from external partners has an independent effect on the ability to export. These findings highlight the need for firms in small cities to develop linkages to the international artistic community, rather than trying to replicate global creative cities at a small scale through relying only or mainly on local cooperation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

We use data obtained from returned questionnaire survey from NPD project leaders in multinational automobiles viewed as technology intensive firms in Thailand to analyze the relationships. Hierarchical regression analysis results suggest that intrinsic motivation can accelerate the influence of project team's potential knowledge absorptive capacity on the long-run NPD project success and that extrinsic motivation demonstrates its role in service of intrinsic motivation moderating the influence of intrinsic motivation with NPD project outcomes. In doing so, we contribute to technology management literature suggesting the condition under which performance impact of knowledge absorptive capacity can be enhanced.

Recent studies argue that the question is not of whether FDI spillover effects exist, but rather of whether the prerequisites for such effects exist. This builds on the notion of absorptive capacity; a country's ability to absorb the benefits FDI offers. This study examines the role of human capital as an absorptive capacity factor for Emerging and Middle Eastern Economies at the sector level. A sample of 30 countries is examined over the period 1990-2009 using panel data analysis. The study makes a contribution by focusing on sector data rather than aggregate FDI inflows to examine the individual sector's influence, allowing for inherent differences.

"Moderating role of absorptive capacity between entrepreneurial orientation and technological innovation capabilities","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992670202&partnerID=40&md5=8990918c0ab062d00378409c937bd61a","The present study purposes to examine the moderating role of absorptive capacity (ACAP) on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and technological innovation capabilities (TIC) among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry. Due to the critical role of SMEs in construction industry, the purpose of this article is to examine to what extent the externally generated knowledge manifested in ACAP can strengthen the relationship between EO and TIC. To validate the proposed model, self-administered questionnaire were conducted to gather data from SMEs owners, 249 questionnaires returned and used for statistical analysis out of 278 distributed. The outcomes of present research reflect that both of ACAP and EO have significant effects on TIC. Furthermore, the results indicate the moderating role of ACAP on the nexus between EO and TIC. © 2016, Econjournals. All rights reserved."
"Does the size matter for dynamics capabilities? A study on absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991798526&doi=10.4067%2fS0718-27242016000300010&partnerID=40&md5=2fc2432f1b636652e9b2cdcadcff366a","The objective of this study is to understand how organizational size influences dynamic capabilities in Brazil. To arrive at this understanding, structural equation modeling analysis was performed using the Brazilian Innovation Survey (PINTEC) database to test for differences between SMEs and large companies in respect to the relationship between absorptive capacity (AC) dimensions and innovation performance. The results show that in large companies, Potential AC and Realized AC impact innovation performance, whereas in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), only Realized AC has an influence. In addition, SMEs are, in fact, better at converting Realized AC into innovation performance than large companies, probably due to their flexibility and agility. These findings reveal that organizational sizes influence the impact of dynamic capabilities on performance. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios."
"The contribution of inward FDI to Chinese regional innovation: The moderating effect of absorptive capacity on knowledge spillover","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969667663&doi=10.1504%2fEJIM.2016.076279&partnerID=40&md5=63f9a2bc27898fd32c94aad73ff4620d","In the regional context of China, this paper examines the extent to which Absorptive Capacity (ABC) contributes to the host country's utilisation of Inward Foreign Direct Investment (IFDI) knowledge spillover and innovation. The findings suggest that the presence of IFDI per se exercises a 'crowding-out' effect on local firms' innovation. In contrast, ABC has a significantly robust moderating effect on innovation so that host country firms' gains from IFDI knowledge spillover depend on whether their ABC offsets the negative impact of the IFDI. Such effects are more evident in coastal areas of China, where the economic mode permits more IFDI and also higher levels of ABC. Incremental innovation is more likely to be expelled by IFDI and motivated by technology elements of ABC, while radical innovation depends more on the human capital aspect of ABC. Our study strongly demonstrates the role of ABC as a moderator of IFDI knowledge spillover. © 2016 The Authors(s)."
"Absorptive capacity, alliance portfolios and innovation performance: An analytical model based on bibliographic research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991746831&partnerID=40&md5=3245f47e20aeea50f6607c1afb10a97c","The objective of this article is to present a model for analysing the role of absorptive capacity in the relationship between strategic alliance portfolios and innovation performance based on the results of bibliographic research on the subject published between 2000 and 2015. The research was carried out in three stages, involving both quantitative - bibliometric and bibliographic coupling - and qualitative content analyses. AP management capabilities were found to have a fundamental moderating role in the AP–IP relationship, and amongst these capabilities AC was highlighted by several authors. However, its role was found to vary according to AP characteristics, notably AP diversity – functional, geographic and institutional, but also centrality, size, stability and volume of resources, alliance and partner types as well as country type: emerging versus developed economies.

"Managerial ties and open innovation: examining the role of absorptive capacity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989857054&doi=10.1108%2fMD-03-2016-0161&partnerID=40&md5=702294ff21ab26ef6e9306dc66eb248b","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of open innovation (OI). It takes into account the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity and explains how a firm’s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends can facilitate OI. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 259 middle and top managers working across different sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Findings: Results obtained using structural equation modeling show that managerial ties facilitate both in-bound and out-bound OI. Results also establish the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity in these relationships. Research limitations/implications: Use of cross-sectional data as was done in this study has been criticized for being inappropriate to test causal models. Besides the findings may not be generalizable to different industries/cultures/regions. Practical implications: This study suggests that managerial ties act to support OI in firms thus giving the insight that managers should be appreciated to build ties with managers of other firms, universities and government officials. Doing so can help firms achieve better OI outcomes. Firms should arrange means of interaction of their managers with these external knowledge sources such as events and occasions where managers of different firms can interact with each other to foster strong ties among them. Originality/value: The above findings contribute theoretically to OI and managerial ties literature while providing insights for practitioners on how to succeed or avoid failure in their OI initiatives. These insights are novel and are new to the OI and managerial ties theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"Absorptive capacity versus distributive capability: The asymmetry of knowledge transfer","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989244217&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-06-2015-0379&partnerID=40&md5=41c61c18ab2230225eebd5eda46eb086","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to disentangle the role of the source and recipient of knowledge in supply chain collaboration by providing evidence that the distributive capabilities of a source, working in conjunction with the absorptive capacity (AC) of a recipient, have direct and significant effects on levels of collaborative engagement between supply chain partners and indirect and significant effects on collaborative operational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilises 310 surveys and structural equations modelling to provide empirical evidence to support the significance of the source of knowledge in collaborative activities. Findings: The study provides evidence for source-based knowledge transfer constructs (distributive capabilities) in supply chain collaboration. Further, this research supports these capabilities working in conjunction with recipient AC both as necessary but insufficient requirements for successful knowledge transfer. Practical implications: Firm interdependence within supply chains continues to grow. In today’s environment of outsourcing and increasing levels of inter-firm activities, this research provides a parsimonious model of collaboration that allows firms to understand knowledge transfer better and how to more aptly manage these types of activities and complex relationships. Originality/value: Earlier research in this domain has focussed on the abilities of a recipient firm to absorb knowledge in order to understand successful collaborative knowledge transfer. By solely focussing on the recipient firm, the role of the source of knowledge has been largely overlooked in this stream of research. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Our analysis is based on an embedded multiple case study of a UK-based MNC, informed by 44 semi-structured interviews and capitalising on agency theory and socialisation theory. Prior knowledge is not a sufficient explanation to the development of ACAP but it is also dependent on organisational mechanisms that will trigger the learning processes. Depending on the nature and degree of the social, control and integration mechanisms, the effects of prior stocks of knowledge on ACAP may vary. Our propositions only hold for one direction of knowledge transfer. The study is based on an embedded multiple case study in one sector which restricts its generalisation. It excludes the specific relationships between the three ACAP learning processes and the existence of feedback loops. Our findings suggest that the HQ's mix of social, control and integration mechanisms should account for initial stocks of SEAR knowledge. The contribution lies in uncovering the interaction between heterogeneous levels of prior knowledge and organisational mechanisms deployed by the HQ fostering ACAP. We address emerging issues regarding the reification of the ACAP concept and highlight the potential of agency theory for informing studies on HQ-subsidiary relations. © Copyright 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The study applies a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify combinations of individual and team factors that are associated with team ACAP. Data were gathered through a survey among 297 employees of four medium-sized Dutch firms, working in 48 functional teams. Findings: The primary finding is that knowledge-intensive team ACAP depends on a triad of complementary factors: team members’ individual ACAP, factors that enable knowledge integration and factors that motivate knowledge integration. Underdevelopment of one or more factors leads to lower team ACAP. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the discussion on the locus of knowledge-creation and enhances understandings of why knowledge-intensive teams differ in knowledge processing capabilities. It suggests future research on cross-functional teams in new ventures and large firms. Practical implications: The paper informs managers and team leaders about the factors that determine knowledge-intensive teams’ ACAP, enabling them to develop team-specific strategies to increase their teams’ performance. Originality/value: The study takes a holistic perspective on knowledge-intensive team ACAP by using a configurational approach. It also highlights the potential of team-level research in the knowledge management literature for both researchers and practitioners. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The chapter reviews the literature, models, and frameworks related to knowledge absorptive capacity. The chapter utilizes a qualitative content analysis as an explanation method in case study research to validate the proposed model. The chapter then analyzes Korean firms as a case in point to illustrate how Korean firms have built their knowledge absorptive capacity. The model consists of four stages: 1) knowledge initiation, 2) knowledge imitation, 3) knowledge improvement, and finally, 4) knowledge innovation or 4KI. The framework shows four development stages at Korean firms as: 1) entrance of foreign companies into the Korean market and their reluctance to transfer their knowledge and information sharing to Korean firms, initiating its knowledge absorptive capacity, 2) Korean firms started knowledge absorptive capacity by means of imitating knowledge from external (especially foreign firms), 3) it then developed knowledge absorptive capacity by means of improving external knowledge, and finally, 4) capability to create their own knowledge and becoming one of the leading economy in the world which challenges firms from advanced countries in the global market. The chapter also highlights the developmental changes in the electronics industry of Korea. Keeping past experiences in consideration, the authors conclude that this model provides useful implications for developing economies, known as latecomers following the same pattern of KAC. © 2016 by IGI Global."

This limited understanding of the diversity ""black box"" may explain why prior research has produced mixed results concerning the relationship between diversity and either group or firm outcomes. Culturally diverse firms experience improved performance when an innovation strategy is in place, and group diversity has been linked to creativity in prior research. This may mean that diversity-creativity linkages are variables responsible for firm performance outcomes. However, there is scant attention paid to how individual and grouplevels of creativity and innovation within the firm result in firm-level innovation. The author of this article explores how firms that value diversity become innovative through their ability to harness creativity and transform it into useful ideas, products, and services. Multi-level creativity is described by the author, and using the diversity perspectives and absorptive capacity framework, the paper discusses how diversity and the manner in which it is managed creates an environment ripe for firm-level innovation to flourish."

This study, however, focused on investigating the moderating role of absorptive capacity and resource capability between management consulting and entrepreneurial firms' performance. So, this study investigated the relationship among consulting quality, consultant capability, absorptive capacity, resource capability, and entrepreneurial firms' performance from the resource based view (RBV). Especially, this study focused on the mediating role of absorptive and resource capability in relational structure of entrepreneurial firms' dimensions. Research design, data, and methodology - In this study, research hypotheses and model are established by the prior researches from the fields of strategic management and entrepreneurial behavior. Concretely, H1~H4 are the relationship between consulting (consulting quality, consultant capability) and innovation (absorptive capacity, resource capability); H5 is the relationship between absorptive capacity and resource capability; and H6~H7 are the relationship between innovation (absorptive capacity, resource capability) and management performance. The data was collected 207 copies from entrepreneurial firms in South Korea. These firms were established in January 2014 and maintained by November 2015 in high-tech industry. The questionnaire was consisted of five dimensions; consulting quality, consultant capability, absorptive capacity, resource capability, and management performance. Each dimension measured multi items on a 5-point Likert scale. The hypotheses and research model are analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with AMOS 22. Results - The results of this study are as follows. 1) Consulting quality significantly influenced on the absorptive capacity of entrepreneurial firms. 2) But, consultant capability did not influence on the absorptive capacity of entrepreneurial firms. 3) Consulting quality and consultant capability significantly influenced on the resource capability of entrepreneurial firms. 4) Absorptive capacity significantly influenced on the resource capability of entrepreneurial firms; 5) Absorptive capacity did not significantly influence on the management performance of entrepreneurial firms. 6) Resource capability, however, significantly influenced on the management performance of entrepreneurial firms. By these results, absorptive capacity of entrepreneurial firms had a mediating role partly among consulting quality, consultant capability, and management capability. The resource capability of entrepreneurial firms had a mediating role among consulting quality, consultant capability, and management capability, perfectly. Conclusions - According to this study, the high level of consulting quality and consultant capability may enforce the resource capability of entrepreneurial firms. It means, practically, that external knowledge is a driver for innovation, and then the innovation effects on the management performance of entrepreneurial firms. So, at the initial stage, the management consulting programs are very important to entrepreneurial firms and should be conceived as an essential element. This study may contribute to the advancement of academic in field of new start business, small business, or venture business based on resources, especially the role of absorptive capacity and resource capability between consulting programs and management performance. However, this study has some limitations. They are the measurement of consulting quality's items, cross-sectional research, and the limitation of concept and industry."

PV enables organisms to detect movement and potential threats in their environment. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the concept of PV in the business environment, as well as its relationship with knowledge structures in the form of technology knowledge and absorptive capacity. The relative importance and significance of technology knowledge and absorptive capacity as mediators between “relational capital” (RC) and “PV” are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports an empirical investigation involving 125 employees from the banking sector. Data collected was statistically analysed using PLS-graph software version 03.00. Results of the data analysis show relationships uncovered in the existing literature. Findings: The creation of RC by employees from the banking sector relies to a large extent on managers’ ability to perceive, analyse and understand activity that is often outside the focus of their attention. Practical implications: Managers who explicitly value their RC have a wider vision of their environment. In turn, a wider understanding of the activity in the environment drives the strengthening of the organisation and its RC. Originality/value: PV can have a direct impact on the organisation’s appetite for the development of its technology knowledge base, thus contributing to enhance the firm’s absorptive capacity as well as the extent, quality and value of its RC. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, the success of this strategy critically depends on acquirers' absorptive capacity. Even if there is common agreement on the role of absorptive capacity, only a few researchers have attempted to investigate how it works in an M&A. To this purpose, we introduce the concept of absorption-related invention as a way to evaluate how, and the extent to which, the knowledge acquired in an M&A is assimilated and transformed into new sources of innovation. Our analysis shows that absorption-related invention positively affects invention performance post-M&A. This effect is stronger in the case of novelty rather than quantity. Furthermore, the roles of technological complementarity, technological similarity, and managerial experience have been tested in relation to both invention performance and absorption-related invention. Our findings confirm the relevance of these factors and suggest that the assimilation of similar technological assets might be important to support the development of novel trajectories of innovation through absorption-related invention.

"Success and failure in international assignments: A review and a proposed multi-dimensional model","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994876165&doi=10.1108%2fJGM-12-2015-0060&partnerID=40&md5=69252e3755e4405ef16efab755631ac3","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on how success and failure for international assignments have been defined, and integrate several proposals for these definitions into a multi-dimensional model that considers task performance, relationship building, contextual performance and retention as all being part of how success or failure should be defined. The authors also discuss two proposed pre-requisites for success – absorptive capacity (operationalized at both the individual and the unit levels) and adjustment. The authors conclude by bringing in literature on performance management and how ideas about performance management must also be integrated into the discussion of the success or failure of international assignments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews existing proposals regarding the definition of expatriate success and failure, and proposes a multidimensional model of success based on the past literature. Based on this literature the authors also propose two pre-requisites for success and discuss several requisite KSAOs, as well as some suggestions from the literature on performance management. Findings: The authors argue for a multidimensional model of expatiate success which includes task performance, relationship building, contextual performance and retention as part of what constitutes a successful assignment. The authors also argue that absorptive capacity and adjustment should be considered as pre-requisites for success, and that principles from performance management should be applied to dealing with international assignments. Research limitations/implications: A more comprehensive definition of success and failure should aid research by providing a better dependent variable, and by leading to research on various aspects of this outcome. Practical implications: The proposed model and approach can hopefully help practice by clarifying the different dimensions of success and how performance management techniques can be applied to dealing with international assignments. Originality/value: There has been a lot written about how we should operationalize the success or failure of international assignments. The present paper reviews that literature and integrates a number of ideas and suggestions into a multi-dimensional model which includes information about pre-requisites for success and relevant KSAOs, along with ideas from performance management to help insure the success of these assignments. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"Key knowledge management processes for innovation: a systematic literature review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015270448&doi=10.1108%2fVJIKMS-02-2015-0017&partnerID=40&md5=c2436b9690e274e64ba4e21fef70feec","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review current literature on knowledge management processes considering the relationship between the key knowledge processes of acquisition, sharing, storage, codification, creation, application and different types of innovation, through a systematic literature review. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows systematic review protocols for management and organisational sciences and analyses 45 full papers on knowledge management processes and innovation. Findings: Results not only show that all knowledge processes can directly support innovation but also that other organisational variables (e.g. organisational learning, absorptive capacity) mediate this relationship. Moreover, knowledge creation and knowledge application appear as two central processes through which knowledge acquisition, sharing, codification and storage influence innovation. Knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing are the most frequently studied knowledge processes. The majority of the sample papers present traditional innovation definitions (product vs process, radical vs incremental and technical vs administrative). However, organisational innovation, innovation capability and innovation performance approaches emerge from the papers’ analysis. Research limitations/implications: The present review includes major scientific papers; however, the search is limited to the Web of ScienceTM platform. Originality/value: This literature review analyses high-quality, peer-reviewed papers, following a systematic methodology that can be tested and updated. Papers were divided based upon the knowledge process(es) being analysed and the innovation type/approach, providing a twofold contribution to knowledge management and innovation literature. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"What goes on beneath the surface of reconfiguration? the impact of redeployment via activity addition and subtraction on firm scope and turnover","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986243969&doi=10.1108%2fS0742-332220160000035008&partnerID=40&md5=53d8e3f1071920f6c48d8812980438d8","Strategy research has long understood that reconfiguration of the scope of the activities a firm engages in over time is critical to its long-run success, while under-emphasizing differences in redeployment strategy that underlie apparently similar scope and changes in scope. In this paper, we build on the idea that a firm's number of activities (scope) and change in activities (turnover) arise from two fundamental rates of redeployment: the rate at which activities are added and the rate at which activities are subtracted. In net, the turnover rate reflects how actively a firm reconfigures its resource base by redeploying resources via addition and subtraction of activities. We develop a model that links addition and subtraction with the composition of a firm's activities and then provide an empirical illustration using data from the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office. As an example of one extension, the model can be generalized to incorporate elements of absorptive capacity. The analysis contributes to our understanding of how firms reconfigure their activities and provide managers with a clearer understanding of tools that guide redeployment of existing resources. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."
"Relational capabilities to leverage new knowledge: Managing directors’ perceptions in UK and Portugal old industrial regions","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997335809&doi=10.1108%2fTLO-03-2016-0022&partnerID=40&md5=78f7c0e0eb93eaae24cc38e214f977ce","Purpose: Focusing on the specific context of two European old industrial regions – South Yorkshire (UK) and North Region of Portugal – this paper aims to identify and conceptualise a set of relational capabilities that business leaders perceive to play a key role in industrial rejuvenation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design operationalised via case studies was followed for the empirical analysis. Data collection was developed through in-depth interviews with managing directors in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) belonging to the metal and engineering industry and the textile and footwear sectors in the two old industrial regions. Data analysis followed the techniques of data categorisation, within case-analysis and cross-case analysis. Findings: The study identifies relational capabilities that firms use to identify, access and leverage new knowledge: frequent meetings with customers; frequent meetings with suppliers; dialogue with government to influence policy that encourages research and technology transfer; partnership actions for the commercialisation of products and services; active membership with sector associations; immersion in science and technological parks; intentionally establishing links with entrepreneurship-supporting entities; human resources development by technical training institutions; and systematic links with the University. The relational capabilities identified require structured communication processes and alliance management practices to enable and support absorptive capacity and learning in inter-organisational networks. Practical implications: The relational capabilities identified can help position regions in specific markets and value chains, contribute to improving regions’ internal and external connections and assist in combining regions’ strengths to create industrial capability in high-growth-potential areas. Originality/value: This paper highlights the role of relational capabilities as a way to secure access to knowledge and competencies needed for firms’ innovation and avoidance of competency traps. This is particularly relevant in the context of European smart specialisation policy, where key regional stakeholders collectively engage in the identification of areas of competitive strength, enhanced coordination and strategic alignment of resources. The study is not without limitations, as findings are based on case studies of SMEs operating in the manufacturing industry and the analysis of relational capabilities is focused on knowledge novelty. © 2016, © Jorge Tiago Martins."
"How to win innovation races in high-tech industries? An evolutionary optimisation model","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955594813&doi=10.1504%2fIJTIP.2016.074240&partnerID=40&md5=f2771dafeee4bbaba88df05758489dfe","In this paper, we will present the firm's knowledge base function and introduce an optimisation problem where the firm seeks to maximise its profits with scarce knowledge assets. In this, it has to share its knowledge assets between activities that help to increase the firm's knowledge base and activities that are needed to protect and exploit the knowledge. In addition to these choices, the firm meets a question of whether and how to use partnerships when trying to maximise profits based on the knowledge assets that can be more or less protected. We will present the evolutionarily inspired optimisation problems as perspectives of one company, two companies and three companies and introduce the differential evolution algorithm as a solution to the optimisation problems. Our simulation results show that by proper optimisation of resource allocations, a company can achieve a sustainable advantage compared with other companies.

Presented is a variety of insights from the investigation of knowledge transfer (KT) practices promoted by an international company following a foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy. A single case-study research strategy collected in-depth data from participants, company archival documentation and stakeholder information. A series of semi-structured interviews were held with 15 employees, where five participants are heads of the departments and the other participants hold supervisory or other managerial roles. The findings are presented as KT practices which are then discussed in regards to organisational performance and effectiveness. The study concludes that KM is not only important for organisational performance but also for the professional development and wellbeing of individuals within the organisation and hence helps organisational culture change. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

One of the most popular strategies for knowledge acquisition is through strategic alliance, which can take the form of international outsourcing or another contractual agreement. As a result of the rising trend of international outsourcing and strategic value of tacit knowledge, this paper aims to provide a conceptual perspective on the importance of prior knowledge, business relatedness and interactive involvement in the acquisition of tacit knowledge from the international suppliers' point of view. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK."

The Chinese government has attempted to rectify this liability by providing funding to assist Chinese firms in developing innovation capability by increasing R&D collaborations and employing external experts. The purpose of this paper is to study the innovation of Chinese firms by examining how internal and external resources interactively impact the innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach - Panel data collected from Chinese manufacturers are used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - The results have shown that the interplay between internal and external resources exhibits differential patterns of impact on innovation capability. The authors discover different moderating patterns of the two types of external resources: visiting experts are helpful in enhancing the effects of internal human resources, while R&D collaborations are useful in exploiting internal financial and physical resources, even when the main effect of financial resources on innovation capability is not significant. Originality/value - The study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidences on the roles of absorbed external resources and knowledge to catalyze internal resources in building up innovation capability in an emerging economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"Tie breadth, tie strength and the location of ties: The value of ties inside an emerging mnc to team innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959482235&doi=10.1142%2fS1363919616500067&partnerID=40&md5=93753da679302e584fe3bc0719308ff2","People differ in terms of the number and strength of ties that they cultivate. Previous literature has tended to focus on either strong ties or many weak ties with a largely unstated assumption that some degree of trade-off exists between the two (underlying trust and novel knowledge, respectively) and their relative contribution to innovation. Within the context of R&D in a SA MNC, this research provided evidence that tie breadth and tie strength are complementary in team innovation. The previously-documented tension between novelty and trust however remains present and becomes evident in the location of ties. Both strong and weak ties contribute most to innovation if they are neither too close (i.e., own team) nor too distant (i.e., outside the MNC). Instead, ties inside the greater R&D unit contributed most to innovation. This role of the location of ties suggests that studies of networks cannot remain limited to tie breadth and strength but has to be rooted in the specific context. This is consistent with prior evidence of innovation within mature and process-driven industries where an in-depth understanding of organisation knowledge is required rather than that of novel technologies. This largely inward orientation has important implications for the competitiveness of emerging MNCs. © 2016 Imperial College Press."
"How firms use external knowledge to improve innovation performance. Evidence from polish manufacturing industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979555722&doi=10.1504%2fIJIL.2016.077841&partnerID=40&md5=db26e69632cf712b5160372e6bdda873","This paper explores the relationship between external knowledge acquisition (EKA) and a firm's innovation performance. In our analysis, the two-equation knowledge production function is applied. In the first step, a firm's decision on the intensity of investment in the EKA is modelled. The model includes technological opportunities and two main elements of the firm's innovation capital, i.e., R&D-based capital and employees' knowledge, as the regressors. In the second step, there is an attempt to find the effect of the intensity of the EKA on the propensity to introduce both product and process innovations. The analysis is based on a large sample of 2,960 manufacturing firms. The micro data have been derived from the Polish Community Innovation Survey, which explores the innovation activities of firms. The methods used in the research are the Tobit and the bivariate Probit models. The results show that the intensity of the EKA depends on the firm's access to institutional knowledge sources, i.e., universities and research centres, and on employees' knowledge. In turn, innovation performance is positively affected by the intensity of the EKA, but this impact is sensitive to the innovation type. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: To perform this study, the authors use data collected from 262 European firms. They apply regression analysis to test the moderating role of an organization’s absorptive and desorptive capacity on enhancing its supply chain competence from its orientation to open innovation. Findings: The results confirm both the influence of power asymmetry and absorptive capacity on obtaining benefits that derive from an organization’s orientation to open innovation. The results do not, however, support the moderating effect of an organization’s desorptive capacity. Subsequent analyses performed in the study show that organizations that achieve complementarity among their own absorptive capacity and the capacities of its supply network manage to obtain greater benefits from its orientation to open innovation.

While the organizational learning (OL) literature has produced a plethora of theories and frameworks, there has been relatively little empirical research on specific mechanisms for internal knowledge generation. Accordingly, this paper aims to answer calls for more research on mechanisms for internal generation of organizational knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an in-depth case study in the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO). Findings: The paper presents a cyclical eight-stage knowledge generation process and demonstrates how agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) may be used to facilitate OL.

Worker mobility and local firms' absorptive capacity also play important roles in learning foreign knowledge in the perspective of local organisations, although the impact is somewhat marginal. Competitive pressure, however, does not exhibit any significant association with knowledge spillovers. This paper contributes to a concept, competitive dynamics, by shedding light on mechanisms of horizontal knowledge spillovers among actors within a strategic group. Some practical implications for managers of MNEs and local firms are also suggested. © 2016 The Authors(s)."

The purpose of this study is to identify the external economy and joint action factors that affect firm innovation and productivity in the IT cluster. A research model was developed based on earlier models of joint action and external economies. The model consists of three external economy related factors, i.e., access to skills, finance, and infrastructure, as well as three joint action related factors, i.e., vertical, horizontal, and research and development (R&D) cooperation as the independent variables, firm innovation as the intervening variable, the firm's absorptive capacity as the moderating variable, and firm productivity as the dependent variable. Data collection was conducted through a survey with respondents from 32 IT firms located in three clusters in Bandung and one cluster in Cimahi (West Java - Indonesia). The partial least square (PLS) approach was used for hypotheses testing. The results indicate that horizontal cooperation, access to infrastructure, and access to skill have a positive impact on productivity, while horizontal cooperation and R&D cooperation have a positive impact on innovation.

The standard two step approach of first testing the measurement model and then estimating the structural model was adopted. Findings: The results provide concrete evidence that among SMEs, deliberate learning has a greater impact on export market learning as compared to experience accumulation, and that market learning has a significant effect on export performance. The results also show that absorptive capacity and commitment to learning are significant co-variates of market learning. Originality/value: This paper focuses on the role of deliberate learning vis-a-vis learning by experience in achieving foreign market learning and export performance in smaller firms.

We present an assessment of the drivers and barriers to the development of social innovation ecosystems through the use of internal (absorptive capacities) and external organizational capabilities (open social innovation). A particular emphasis is placed on social innovation outcomes and impacts. The capability approach is particularly useful for measuring social innovation impacts and investigating the ""micro-meso-macro"" of linkages that underlie the process of social innovation. Methodology/approach - Our methodological approach measures social innovations' outcomes and impact through an aggregative model, which takes into consideration different forms of capabilities that are engendered in the process of or as a result of social innovation. This methodology highlights the importance of social innovation drivers and contexts in which knowledge exploration and exploitation lead to the creation of capabilities that help social innovators to respond to unfulfilled social needs. Findings - The research presented in this chapter provides a new perspective on how the capability approach can be used to assess and measure individual and collective actions when facing social challenges. Research implications - Our research supports and complements the findings of the EU project SIMPACT an acronym for ""Boosting the Impact of SI in Europe through Economic Underpinnings,"" by highlighting the processes and outcomes and SI impact measurement. Social - The measurement of social innovation outcomes and impact has gained importance for policy makers and constitutes a strategic tool for designing policies in support of social entrepreneurs, social investors, and private and public organizations which participate in cocreating and implementing innovative projects. Originality/value - The research presented in this chapter sheds light on the ""micro-meso-macro"" linkages that foster social innovation ecosystems, and offer valuable tools and guidelines to researchers, practitioners, and policymaker in the field of innovation in general and social innovation in particular.

In this paper, I looked at the effect of collaborative relationship between medical doctors and engineers on the productivity of the development based on interviews on R&D of artificial retina and bibliometric analysis on R&D of cochlear implant. In the interviews with medical doctors and engineers involved in R&D of artificial retina in the United States, Germany, and Japan, we found that medical doctors and engineers perceive that the collaboration is one of the key factors to the success in inventing and developing medical devices, but that the good collaborative relationship is difficult to maintain. Next we examined such collaboration quantitatively by conducting bibliometric analysis of research articles and patents related to the development of cochlear implant, and found the important role played by medical doctors and their collaboration with engineers when designing and improving the medical device, and that more collaboration between medical doctors and engineers is seen in the more productive R&D group. Considering those findings, development of a medical device needs not only the 'user-led' forces of medical doctors but also close interdisciplinary collaboration between medical doctors and engineers as a team. For such collaborative team effort to succeed, absorptive capacity of both sides and proximity between them are important, while there are barriers between a medical doctor and an engineer including cognitive, organizational, social, and institutional factors. To overcome those barriers, experiences of cooperation, education, geographic proximity, good leadership, or member's personality can promote some elements of proximity to compensate for lack or shortage of other elements of proximity. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

With this paper, we contribute to research on the individual level of analysis by analysing specific perspectives in the context of creative industries. Our study is based on 36 interviews with Haute cuisine chefs in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland listed in the 2012 Michelin Guide. Building on the OI capability concept, our results demonstrate that chefs use absorptive and desorptive capacity (AC, DC) as means to generate and market culinary innovations, respectively. Moreover, we found that chefs almost exclusively rely on their own inventive and innovative capabilities in the early stages of the culinary innovation process. In subsequent phases, however, chefs increasingly integrate other sources such as employees, suppliers, and guests. Our study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we research the individual level within the OI process, and second, we provide insight into OI practices in the creative industries. © 2016 Imperial College Press."
"Developing effective local content regulations in sub-Sahara Africa: The need for more effective policy alignment","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999736768&doi=10.1108%2fMBR-08-2015-0040&partnerID=40&md5=bcaecfa0abb46605357647d9992ce5c9","Purpose: The authors propose a strategic-balance approach to local content laws in which less developed economies in sub-Sahara Africa can develop investment incentive policies for attracting multinationals and direct foreign investment but, at the same time, have a structured and operational framework for the enforcement of local content laws. The purpose of the paper is to identify the elements involved in the equation: the incentives, the potential spillovers and the criteria for evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: The approach involves a review of the literature and the operational details and limitations of local content laws in sub-Sahara Africa. Findings: The paper develops a conceptual model for a holistic understanding and management of this dilemma by policymakers and development practitioners to maximize the benefits of natural resources to less developed countries in sub-Sahara Africa towards the fight against poverty and underdevelopment. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides the opportunity to influence policy direction in relation to the adoption of investment incentive policies and programs and the enforcement of local content policy guidelines and regulations in sub-Sahara Africa. Practical implications: Multinational companies (MNCs) operating in less developed and emerging economies in sub-Sahara Africa should consider how their economic and corporate social responsibility activities can help develop the capabilities of the local workforce through training and development activities; develop domestic firms’ capabilities via enterprise development programs; and develop local firm’s absorptive capacities through knowledge transfers and innovation systems to support development activities. Social implications: Policymakers in less developed and emerging economies in sub-Sahara Africa need to strike a balance in adopting investment incentives policies towards attracting foreign investments and the enforcement of local content regulations to make sure they derive the maximum benefits from their strategic resources. It is important for policymakers to understand that the mere attraction of MNCs into an economy does not explicitly guarantee domestic job creation; rather, it depends on how MNCs respond to local content policy regulations through their business strategies. Linking investment incentives with local content policy regulations at a critical point could potentially support and strengthen industrial development in sub-Sahara Africa. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to examine the challenges of both attracting foreign direct investment and enforcing local content laws and regulations in sub-Sahara Africa. This paper contributes to the understanding of this dilemma and how less developed economies can manage such a crucial and important issue using our proposed strategic-balance approach. The contribution of local content laws and the design and adoption of investment incentives policies and programs to attract foreign investment to promoting sustainable domestic growth and development must depend on the balance between the enforcement of local content policy guidelines and the provision of such investment incentive packages to attracting foreign investment. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This study applied organizational learning theory with a demand-side perspective to explore whether the mixed findings could be due to confounding a positive effect of knowledge variety with a negative effect arising from market separation. Compared with firms with only domestic or foreign customers, firms with both types of customers have more opportunities to acquire diverse knowledge and form innovative combinations, but serving disparate customers tends to inhibit knowledge transfer, sharing and integration. Data on 8529 Chinese automobile and component manufacturers were analyzed to test these arguments, and firms competing in less separated domestic and overseas markets were found to demonstrate the best innovation performance. Firms with greater absorptive capacity were found better able to overcome the difficulties caused by market separation and enjoy more benefits from market variety. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

However, while considerable attention has been paid to patenting by small and midsize technology firms, the underlying business motivations for such firms to publish scientific papers are not well understood. This paper investigates the scientific publishing patterns of smaller firms engaged in nanotechnology and the factors that underlie this phenomenon. Based on an analysis of 85 US small and midsize enterprises with a minimum of four nanotechnology patents or publications, we test three hypotheses about corporate publishing: reputational gains, absorptive capacity, and strategic spillovers. We find that the small and midsize firms in our sample are more likely to publish when their work is associated with public science and when it involves a greater technological focus, but having a university collaborator is not a significant factor. The results from this study of nanotechnology enterprises suggest that small and midsize technology firms selectively manage and disclose their research based on internal developmental and capacity drivers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Because innovations are usually developed by project teams, this suggests that absorptive capacity, as a construct, may also be usefully applied at the team level. Consequently, this study developed a measure for team-level absorptive capacity, investigated the potential influencing factors, and examined its relationship to team effectiveness in terms of product innovativeness in an interorganizational context. Specifically, building on the theory of homophily and information and decision-making theories, three factors (social-category similarity, work-style similarity, and knowledge complementarity between the recipient and the partner organization teams) were identified as likely antecedents of team absorptive capacity. The hypotheses were tested on data from 98 interorganizational new product development teams and included responses from team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. With regard to the antecedents of team absorptive capacity in interorganizational settings, the results showed a significant positive association with partners' work-style similarity and an inverted U-shaped relationship with partners' knowledge complementarity. Social-category similarity was not significantly associated with team absorptive capacity. We also examined whether team absorptive capacity was related to interorganizational team effectiveness and found a significant positive relationship between team absorptive capacity and product innovativeness. The study demonstrates that absorptive is indeed related to team effectiveness outcomes in an interorganizational context, which underlines the importance of team-level absorptive capacity for product innovation management and suggests paying more attention to the lower levels of absorptive capacity. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association."

Using data of 5,080 foreign invested subsidiaries in 2003–2010, our findings support the hypotheses that market-seeking orientation becomes more profitable for foreign subsidiaries in China when (1) the host country provides a more favorable institutional framework towards FDI; (2) the subsidiary has a longer history of FDI operation in the host country that leads to stronger absorptive capacity; and (3) the subsidiary is organized in a wholly owned manner. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

This study is grounded in information processing theory, and examines the role of absorptive capacity in linking a firm's responsive strategy and performance. We test a structural equation model on data from 711 manufacturing firms, and validate our results on a second sample of 677 firms. Our study makes three major contributions by providing evidence that: (1) absorptive capacity is motivated by a firm's responsive strategy; (2) it fully mediates the relationship between responsive strategy and firm performance, indicating that absorptive capacity is a necessary competence for firms that aim to deliver innovative products to customers; and (3) the relationship between responsive strategy and absorptive capacity is U-shaped, indicating that when firms attempt to blend efficient and responsive strategies, their ability to develop absorptive capacity is diminished. © 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc."

We assess the returns to the scientists, firms, and countries associated with GMR. We find that the French and German scientists that discovered GMR and their labs benefited by receiving the Nobel Prize and small licensing fees. The firm that first commercialized the technology, IBM, captured profits from selling hard disk drives and magnetic heads using GMR. Other hard disk drive and head manufacturers based in the U.S. and Japan were able to quickly assimilate the technology and catch up with IBM. France and Germany reaped limited returns due to the lack of domestic firms with the absorptive capacity to commercialize GMR. The U.S. and Japan benefited from the success of their firms in commercializing GMR, as did other countries which were part of the global value chains of those companies. Consumers and firms that incorporated hard drives in their products ultimately benefited from cheaper hard drives with greater capacity. These findings illustrate the importance of absorptive capacity at the firm and national level in capturing benefits from innovation. They also show that the benefits to first mover firms can be short-lived in a competitive industry with open transfer of knowledge and limited appropriability regimes. Finally, they show that the location of jobs and wages associated with innovative products depends on the structure of the global value chains of leading firms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The technological innovation systems framework is used to analyze the process of technology diffusion as well as the emergence of a new wind sector in Portugal, where this renewable energy technology showed a spectacular development in the past decade. This framework highlights the main processes or functions that occur in the diffusion of a new technology. The evidence obtained demonstrates that the fulfillment of these functions, which were mostly studied in the context of pioneer countries, is still pertinent to explain the formation of a wind energy system in this follower country. Yet the type of resources and the nature of the activities needed to adopt the technology in the latter often differ. This case provides new insights into the importance of functions that enhance the follower's capacity to assimilate the new technology (e.g. local knowledge development, experimentation), thus creating the conditions for a fast move as soon as innovations become sufficiently mature in the core. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc."

Using survey questionnaire data from senior executives in firms collaborating with university research centers our focus in this study was AEK in the way of the firm advancing new products, new processes, and improvements to existing products and processes. Our results show that a more technologically uncertain external environment is positively associated with AEK and firm age is associated with AEK in a curvilinear, inverted U-shape fashion such that as firms mature they assimilate external knowledge better up to a certain point when diminishing returns come into play. We also found tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge moderate these relationships in different ways. Our findings can help managers develop strategies to maximize AEK to increase innovation, shorten technology development time, and reduce R&D costs. We also inform managers and policy-makers on the value of university-industry alliances for driving innovation and advancing new technologies.

We develop a theoretical framework that unpacks organizational learning into mechanisms and outcomes. The outcomes of organizational learning are distinguished at two levels: first-order and second-order. Based on the framework, we propose a research model set in the franchising context. We conceptualize franchisee use of IT provided by the franchisor as an important learning mechanism that impacts knowledge transfer effectiveness (first-order outcome) and absorptive capacity (second-order outcome). Further, the influence of IT use on financial performance is mediated through absorptive capacity. The model was tested on a sample of 783 independently owned realestate franchisees using a comprehensive dataset comprised of primary and secondary data. The results indicate that IT use is an important learning mechanism for franchisees by impacting knowledge transfer effectiveness and absorptive capacity. In turn, absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between IT use and financial performance. The empirical support for the research model serves to affirm the underlying learning mechanisms-outcomes framework. The results are stable across the choice of statistical method and the operationalization of financial performance.

While several studies have identified different firm-specific resources that influence new product advantage, comparatively little research has explored the contribution of strategic supplier resources. Combining resource-based and relational perspectives, this study develops a theoretical model investigating how a strategic supplier's technical capabilities impact focal firm new product advantage and how firms combine different resources to gain this advantage. The model is tested using detailed survey data collected from 153 interorganizational new product development projects in the United Kingdom within which a strategic supplier had been extensively involved. Empirical results support our research hypotheses. First, supplier technical performance is shown to have a significant positive impact on new product advantage. Next, we show that while supplier technical capabilities have a positive influence on supplier technical performance, the a priori nature of the supplier's task moderates the relationship. Finally, our data support our hypotheses related to the positive relationship between relationship-specific absorptive capacity and new product advantage, and the proposed negative moderation of supplier technical capabilities on this relationship. Based upon these findings, we encourage managers to recognize that strategic suppliers' with greater technical capabilities perform better regardless of the degree of creativity required by their task; but that strategic suppliers with lower technical capabilities may partially compensate (substitute) for their lack of technical capabilities, if they are able to respond to high problem-solving task requirements. Furthermore, we suggest that the firm's development of relationship-specific absorptive capacity is much more important when a strategic supplier is less technically capable. A buying firm's relationship-specific absorptive capacity can, according to our data, substitute for low supplier technical capabilities. On the other hand, where the supplier has strong technical capabilities, investments in relationship-specific absorptive capacity have no effect on new product advantage. Our findings reinforce recent calls for research on how firms can combine different resources and capabilities to achieve superior performance. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association."

One proposed success factor is technological distance, which determines the probability of receiving new knowledge from a partner as well as the ability of absorbing it. The methodology for measuring this distance is receiving broad attention in current literature. Therefore, we compare well-established measuring methods based on Euclidian distances with the recently introduced method of the min-complement distance.Collaborations along the entire value chain are seen as a way to overcome technological deficiencies associated with battery development for electric mobility, which implies collaboration of partners with different technological distances.

These care transitions represent a domain of high-risk interorganizational collaborations. However, a conversation about how health information technology (HIT) can enhance interorganizational knowledge transfer during care transitions is largely absent in the information systems literature. We conducted a review of qualitative studies of post-hospital care transitions to better understand barriers to knowledge transfer in high-risk interorganizational collaborations. Our analysis highlights how time pressures inhibit multilateral knowledge transfers, accommodation of fluctuating absorptive capacity, and reconciliation of knowledge and goal conflicts. We advance research questions that focus on HIT capabilities to ease these barriers. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

We take a contingency perspective in the present research to investigate why this may be the case. Unlike most prior studies, we examine the issue from the viewpoint of the supplier as the recipient of buyer-driven knowledge transfer, and assess factors that may attenuate or hamper its effect on the supplier's operational performance. We suggest, basing our arguments on the theoretical framework of motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA), that while buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities provide an opportunity for enhancing the supplier's operational performance, the degree to which this opportunity is realized depends upon both the relative absorptive capacity (ability), as well as the supplier's trust in the buyer, and the supplier's innovativeness (motivation). Specifically, we theorize that the supplier's perceived overlapping knowledge and its perceived cognitive congruence with the buyer (reflective of the supplier's relative absorptive capacity) and the supplier's trust in the buyer serve as positive moderators, and the supplier's own innovativeness as a negative moderator. We assess these hypotheses within a unique context, namely that of small- and medium-sized suppliers of large South Korean conglomerates (so-called chaebols), using hierarchical linear modeling. Our findings extend the academic literature in supplier development by providing insight into important contingencies influencing the effectiveness of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities for improved operational performance of suppliers, based on the MOA framework, and offer valuable lessons for practitioners in crafting more effective supplier development strategies. © 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc."

Consequently, firms need to develop both technological capital (a patent portfolio) and alliance capital (a portfolio of technology alliances). This paper examines the relationship between technological capital, alliance capital, and their joint impact on the technological performance of firms, with an application to the application-specific integrated circuit industry. We find that positive marginal returns to alliance capital are decreasing at higher levels of alliance capital. Technological capital and alliance capital can either augment or reduce each others' influence on innovation performance depending on the stage of the technology life cycle in the industry. A reinforcing relationship related to absorptive capacity requirements and technological uncertainty is present in early stages, while technology leakage and market competition effects render the combination of high levels of technological and alliance capital counterproductive in later stages of the technology life cycle. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association."

In particular, conceiving knowledge as a trajectory across pole of attraction rather than a linear process, the authors develop a model inspired by the solar system metaphor.

Using the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2006-2008, we refer to the firm's probability of both introducing an EI and extending the number of EI-typologies adopted. We estimate the impact of the 'depth' and 'breadth' of knowledge sourcing. In addition, we test for the moderating role of the firm's absorptive capacity. Knowledge sourcing has a positive impact on both types of EI-performance. However, a broad sourcing strategy reveals a threshold above which the propensity to introduce an EI diminishes. Cognitive constraints in processing knowledge inputs that are too diverse may explain this result. Absorptive capacity generally helps firms to turn broadly sourced external knowledge into EI. However, internal innovation capabilities and knowledge socialization mechanisms seem to diminish the EI impact of knowledge sourced through deep external interactions. The possibility of mismatches between the management of internal and external knowledge, and of problems in distributing the decision-makers' attention between the two, may explain this result. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

However, the majority of studies have focused on the factors leading to academic entrepreneurship, while only few study the performance of these ventures. Moreover, this strand of the literature has focused solely on start-ups by university faculty. This study adds to these by including university graduates in the definition of academic entrepreneurs and controlling for the industry environment in which the new venture is founded; both aspects, which are recommended in recent studies. Longitudinal register data combined with responses from 1,151 first-time entrepreneurs in 2004 are used to explore the self-selection of individuals into certain industry environments and their subsequent performance—survival and growth—in the chosen environment. This study works from the hypothesis that university education (technical and non-technical) and industry experience increase new venture performance in high-profit and high-uncertainty industries, respectively, because of increased knowledge and skills; in addition, education and experience engender higher absorptive capacities and adaptability. The analysis controls for personal traits, social capital, and financial capital. Technical academics are found to perform better in both profitable and uncertain industries, whereas non-technical academics perform better only in profitable industries. Nevertheless, both types of academics are more likely to enter uncertain industries. The absorptive capacities of technical academics make these individuals particularly important in technology transfers to new ventures in unstable environments, which are important in developed economies. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Exogenous factors of the external environment such as market and technology turbulence and competitive intensity are assumed to induce a firm to source knowledge externally for innovation, whereas endogenous factors such as ambiguity avoidance, organizational inertia, and low absorptive capacity may inhibit external knowledge sourcing. In this study, particularly, we examine both the direct effects of exogenous and endogenous factors as well as the moderating effect of the exogenous factors on firm-specific characteristics on a firm's external knowledge sourcing decision. We postulate that on the one hand, environmental factors may prompt firms to source knowledge externally; however, they may also prevent firms from engaging in external knowledge sourcing by moderating specific organizational attributes endogenous to the firm, thus producing a dual effect.

Our arguments highlight the role of absorptive capacity and examine how industry appropriability influences these relations. Based on a rich dataset of 8 416 firms, we argue that basic research in firms increases their knowledge stock and flows, therefore improving their capacity to identify, assimilate, and exploit external knowledge, which allows them to enhance their product innovation performance. We also verify that strong appropriability regimes not only reduce the effect of basic research on absorptive capacity, but also affect the relation between absorptive capacity and product innovation in two ways. In businesses with a high absorptive capacity, strong appropriability regimes exert a negative influence by reducing product innovation; however, businesses with a low absorptive capacity see their level of product innovation increase. This evidence not only throws into question the attitude of many managers toward basic research; it also calls for open reflection on both the net effect of appropriability on innovative performance and the stages of the innovation process to which public resources should be allocated. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

This research argues that knowledge protection is deterred by the large institutional distance between partners and that the alliance performance cannot be improved because of the decreased absorptive capacity. However, such negative impacts of country- and firm-specific characteristics can be alleviated if relational capital is substantially accumulated by partners to enhance cross-border knowledge transfer and learning processes. This research explores whether frequent interactions, strong mutual trust and reciprocal commitment positively moderate the impact of knowledge protection on absorptive capacity and that of absorptive capacity on alliance performance.

The results indicate a set of direct and indirect relationships that illustrate: (1) the importance of organizational fitness at the base of the sand cone of practices, (2) the cumulative relationship of competitive performance, supporting the sand cone model, and (3) the cumulative relationship between lean bundles and the sand cone sequence of cumulative performance. Testing alternative models of cumulative performance lends further support to these results. The findings are discussed in terms of implications for managers seeking guidance in competing on multiple dimensions of competitive performance simultaneously, particularly in terms of establishing a foundation of organizational fitness for the cumulative implementation of lean bundles. It contributes to the literature on manufacturing strategy and lean by providing additional support for the sand cone of cumulative performance, expanding research on the sand cone of practices that support cumulative performance, describing the role that external resources like suppliers can play in mastering lean cumulatively and separating previous research on lean bundles into those related to fitness and those with a more specific goal orientation, building on the strong foundation provided by the extended resource based view and the concept of absorptive capacity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

This empirical study discusses the determinants of R&D outsourcing with respect to various theories of the firm that complement each other. Data from the Third and Fourth European Community Innovation Survey for Belgium reveal internal R&D intensity to exert a strong positive association with R&D outsourcing intensity, emphasising the importance of absorptive capacity and the complementary nature of internal and outsourced R&D.

This study explores the relationships of these elements on the acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation learning processes of absorptive capacity. Data were obtained through a mailed survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that RII, KIBS and value chain information sources affect a firm's absorptive capacity, leading to better innovation performance. Specifically, KIBS improves the acquisition process, value chain information sources improve the acquisition and assimilation processes, and RII improve the transformation process.

We conceptualize absorptive capacity along two dimensions-technological effort and technological capability-and hypothesize that these two dimensions have opposing moderating effects which can result in theoretical and empirical misspecifications if ignored. We argue that firms with higher technological efforts have greater motivation to search for knowledge from their alliance partners, place more value on the external knowledge and mobilize such knowledge, and face lower internal resistance to assimilate and to use the knowledge. On the other hand, firms with stronger technological capability have lower motivation to search for knowledge from alliance partners, put lower value on the knowledge, make less intense efforts to mobilize it, and face greater internal resistance in assimilating and using the knowledge. By analyzing longitudinal data of 178 U.S.-based public semiconductor firms during 1988-2000 using negative binomial regression, we find that as firms increase their technological effort, the benefits from alliance network resources in terms of technological innovations come at a higher rate. In contrast, as technological capabilities of firms increase, the benefits from the alliance network resources in the form firm technological innovations come at a lower rate. We further discuss important theoretical and managerial implications of our findings. © 2015."

ISO management standards reduce performance variability among suppliers and promote global trade. However, ISO standards also promote a certain degree of commonality or isomorphism between firms. If the very notion of 'standards' encourages a certain level of commonality between firms, then how can firms achieve a competitive advantage from implementing ISO standards? This research argues that the timing of when a firm implements an ISO standard relative to their rivals has strategic benefits. Drawing on the competitive dynamics literature we argue that firms can achieve an early mover advantage when implementing ISO 14001. However, an early mover advantage depends on the level of a firm's absorptive capacity (prior experience with ISO 9001) and the competitive intensity of their industry. This study uses longitudinal data from firms that implemented ISO 14001 at varying points in time to examine the benefits of an early mover advantage. More broadly, this research sheds light on when firms benefit the most from implementing new management standards. The results provide insights into implementing other emerging management standards. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Technological convergence and the absorptive capacity of standardisation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920175754&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2014.02.022&partnerID=40&md5=534cb3017f5b43c0d7e2fb7c2715ea16","In this paper a method of identifying trends in technological convergence on the level of technical fields is proposed. Defining convergence as an inherently stable process of structuring inter-technological patterns over time, German patent data are used to project them onto the structure of the output of standards via a concordance list of International Patent Classifications (IPC) symbols and International Classification of Standards (ICS) classes. Using a set of criteria for a reliable measurement of technological convergence, a set of methods, such as explorative identification of agglomerations of technical fields, the analyses of the breadth of technical fields to differentiate between focused and diffused convergence trends and in-depth analysis using a revised version of the Cross-Impact Assessment method, are devised to measure the level and trend of technological convergence. The structures of convergence in technological development and standardisation are in general moderately positively correlated, but that there are significant differences on how these converging trends are covered in the stock of active standards at the level of technical fields. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

This research focuses on one characteristic of the process of strategic change, i.e., its speed. This study investigates the relationship between dynamic capabilities, the speed of strategic change, and performance. We propose that technological capabilities, marketing capabilities, and market-linking capabilities, due to their absorptive capacity and boundary spanning attributes, will facilitate the speed of strategic change. Furthermore, the risk orientation of managers will moderate this effect such that it would be strengthened for relatively risk-taking managers. Finally, we argue that the speed of strategic change will have an inverted-U relationship with organizational performance. We test these hypotheses on a sample of 213 Chinese firms and find that while dynamic capabilities facilitate rapid strategic change, the risk orientation of decision makers moderates this relationship, but not all as hypothesized. While faster implementation of strategic change has a positive effect on performance, strategic change carried out too quickly has negative performance repercussions. Our findings suggest that firms not only need to adjust strategies to complement the changing environment, but also have corresponding capabilities to enable rapid strategic change. © 2014 IEEE."

The article is a contribution to tourism history, and it introduces a new facet of tourism innovation research. Scientific and technological progress facilitates the development of tourism, but often with some delay. The trickling down depends on institutional changes and absorptive capacity in the tourism sector. The impacts contributed mainly to the social and physical efficacy of tourists, including reduction of risks and improved mobility and accessibility. Innovations also laid the ground for entirely new touristic experiences. Numerous innovations were implemented to increase the productivity and performance of tourism enterprises. The article provides examples of innovations that led to the opening of new destinations. Institutional and informational innovations proliferated into critical modernization.

Since then, the concept has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. However, previous research paid sparse attention to determinants of absorptive capacity and especially the single dimensions of the knowledge absorption process. Consequently, it remains unclear why some firms are better able to absorb new external knowledge than others. This paper focuses on organizational structure as one important determinant of absorptive capacity. Using case studies of two German high-tech firms, the paper discusses four structural factors influencing the acquisition, integration and exploitation dimensions of absorptive capacity: division form, R&D centrality, gatekeeper positions and interface positions.

Enhancing absorptive capacity is essential to ensure a firms long-term competitiveness. The foundation of absorptive capacity relies greatly on prior related knowledge and diversity of background concerning an aggregated system that can explain how the entire mechanism works. Regarding more direct efforts to explore systematically the interdependence between existing construct variables and others new constructs to label the capabilities of a firm to enhance this capability, the outcomes remain surprisingly rare. Till date, researchers' understanding of the key macro-micro (organisation-individual) linkage of acquiring, assimilating, transforming, and exploiting development has not been examined comprehensively. Thus, the premise of this research is to propose a ""macro-micro dynamic integrative design"" that will shift the learning landscape of absorptive capacity that internally can drive more effective learning and capability development. © 2015 Imperial College Press."

It first defines a firm's capacity to absorb spillovers as a latent variable observable indirectly through its underlying dimensions. By means of structural equation modelling based on survey datasets collected within small and medium manufacturing enterprises expecting to engage in special economic zone activities, it investigated the impact of absorptive capacity and its correlation with the performance of firms. Three dimensions that correlated to firm characteristics (technology, networks, and human factors) were found to reflect absorptive capacity. Importantly, it also found that absorptive capacity mediated the relationship between firm characteristics and firm performance to only a moderate degree. In terms of policy implications, if high absorptive capacity is a precondition for effectively reaping external spillovers, this paper's findings suggest that exploitation of SEZ-induced spillovers could likely be limited unless local governments take action to strengthen the absorptive capacity of firms.

The concept is at risk of reification. With this study we contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence for absorptive capacity which challenge the assumptions of how the construct is configured. We follow the strategic factor of intellectual property rights (IPR) in European biopharmaceutical firms using a qualitative process study with temporal bracketing. By tracking IPR, we found evidence for absorptive capacity in all firms we studied, but the process framework in use is different to Zahra and George's (2002. Acad. Manage.

Thus, this paper looks at different expected outputs in terms of more or less radical innovations and sees if there are consequences on the absorptive process underpinning cognitive structures and processes, as embodied in its organizational and social capital. Design/methodology/approach – To do so, a qualitative study was conducted. In total, 23 persons in three French industrial firms were interviewed about their firm’s absorptive capacity. One of these firms aims at “new-to-the-firm” innovations, while the other two aim at “new-to-the-world” innovations. Findings – Results suggest that while “new-to-the-firm” innovations tend to favor the use of social capital, “new-to-the-world” innovations tend to rely more on organizational capital.

In this paper we develop a conceptual model that captures the RI practices among 61 academic spin-offs and investigate how it affects the capacity of the firm to absorb external knowledge to better the exploitation of the innovation. The findings indicate that potential absorptive capacity is increased by both stakeholder engagement and social responsiveness, while realized absorptive capacity is moderately increased through social responsiveness. Remarkable is the finding that the extent that sustainability practices resonate in the start-ups operations does have a negative effect on the potential absorptive capacity. These results provide insight in the way in which start-ups adopt a RI philosophy to their innovation process and help to better understand how they learn and acquire external knowledge to increase the acceptance of their innovations. The findings provide clear recommendations for entrepreneurs and policymakers in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation. © 2015 V.E. Scholten and P.A. van der Duin."

Drawing on a database of 127 science-to-industry R&D projects in technology-based markets, our study results show the inherent relevance of complexity and absorptive capabilities for value creation. Contrary to expectations, prior knowledge has no significant effect on value creation per se. Instead, the impact of complex technological knowledge on value creation is enhanced at high levels of both prior knowledge and absorptive capabilities. The findings suggest that following a well-worn path leads to competence traps, whereas knowledge-related learning capabilities enable a firm to deal with dynamic environments. The findings have implications for managerial decisions and theory regarding how value can be created from complex knowledge in technology transfer settings. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Through original sociometric data collected from 276 scientists, researchers, and engineers from the Research and Development division of a large multinational high-tech company, I show that the effects of external knowledge on individuals' innovativeness are contingent upon individuals' position in the internal social structure. In particular, results indicate that the positive effects of external knowledge on innovation generation become more positive when individuals sourcing external knowledge span structural holes in the internal knowledge-sharing network.

However, most of these developments have been theoretical in nature, and have been conducted in single-firm contexts. Our study answers prior calls for more empirical and mathematical treatments in multi-firm contexts that nurture a vibrant and balanced research stream. Our study adopts a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the influence of absorptive capacity on the performance of a firm in a dynamic multi-firm context. We develop a theoretical framework that drives the modeling exercise to gain insights on two research questions: (1) Relative to the dominant player in the industry, what level of ACap should a firm be endowed with to increase its long-term value in a dynamic environment? (2) Is there a threshold value of ACap endowment that makes it more likely for a firm to challenge the dominant player in the industry? We provide an analytical result, and further, we conduct a numerical study with two firms and seven periods. Our results suggest that there are ACap hurdle rates that a firm must meet to survive and grow. In addition, our model suggests that smaller firms in an industry may do well to strive for unique combinations of ACap, prior knowledge, and initial firm value, to compete successfully against the dominant player in the industry. Our work serves to open new avenues for future research that addresses the influence of ACap endowments on firm performance in dynamic multi-firm environments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Early adoption of laser technology research was especially prevalent in large agglomerations. While we cannot detect knowledge spillovers from adjacent regions, geographic proximity to the center of initial laser research was conducive to early adoption of laser research; however, the effect is negligibly small. The earlier a region embarked on this type of research, the higher the level of laser research later, indicating the accumulation of knowledge generated in previous periods. Our results highlight the role of a region's absorptive capacity for commencing and conducting research in a new technological field. An interregional transfer of tacit knowledge was largely unimportant for the spatial diffusion of research in this technological field. © 2014, Taylor & Francis."

Focusing on the territorial dimension, we investigated the role played by shared vision in the effects of internal resources (absorptive capacity) and external resources (network positioning) on the innovation of firms. To address the research questions, the empirical study drew on a sample of firms belonging to the Valencian textile cluster in Spain. Our findings suggest that networking and firm resources affect performance independently. Furthermore, internal and relational resources are positively active thanks to shared vision. More generally, we aim to contribute to the discussion on the degree to which firms should be involved in the cluster network in order to gain competitive advantages. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

However, it is still not clear how this effect takes place and what internal capabilities are involved in the process. We propose to open the black box between external knowledge search strategies, and innovation and performance by proposing absorptive capacity (AC) as the mediating variable. A sample of 102 biotechnology firms from Spain is used to test the proposed theoretical model through structural equation modeling taking the partial least squares approach. Results suggest that AC acts as a full mediator in the relationship between the depth of external knowledge search and the innovation and business performance of the firm.

This study proposes and tests if customer collaboration is supported by ACAP and mediates the effect of ACAP on innovation performance. An established and previously validated second-order construct of ACAP is suggested to test these hypothesised relationships. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to a sample of 120 selected gazelle companies that have had stable growth rates during the past three years to analyse the proposed relationships.

KBUD research stands out in that, besides measuring the campuses' characteristics, it also includes the effect of a number of external environments on the successful development of a city. However, so far, it has overlooked the importance of measuring absorptive quality of a city region. In this article, we propose an extension of the knowledge-based urban development (KBUD) model with an additional pillar that measures the level of absorptive quality of a region on the basis of local networking and cooperation activity. The extensive model shows that although the development program of the Limburg region scores good in the field of economic quality, the absorptive capacity of the region is less well developed.

This study provides empirical evidence of its importance within a substantial sample of Chinese large firms and small and medium enterprises. Using Tobit regression analysis, our findings indicate that external knowledge sources from inter-firm networking are more important in creating the benefits of open innovation for Chinese small and medium enterprises than their larger peers. Linkages to university and research institutes generally have few direct effects on the innovation performance of both large and small firms in China. However, the role of universities and research institutes is shown to be important among our large firm sample when combined with evident internal absorptive capacity. This interaction is generally limited to our large firm sample, and is not as evident among small firms. Our study indicates that the barriers to the adoption of open innovation by Chinese firms might be largely related to the comparatively weak domestic research expertise and limited organisational absorptive capabilities, with this most particularly evident for small and medium enterprises. These findings suggest that, based on this evidence, there is no need for emerging economies like China to mimic the emergence path from closed to open innovation followed by developed countries. Chinese firms will be more likely to garner the benefits available from openness when they develop the capabilities required to identify, assimilate and commercialise knowledge and technologies obtained from external sources. © 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management."

Under this rationale has emerged a research stream where knowledge management, organizational learning, or intellectual capital, help to understand and constitute the key pieces of one of the most complex business phenomena; the 'firm's technological advantage'. This being so, it is also true that in knowledge-based and high-tech industrial markets, competitive success comes directly from continuous technological innovations, where a single organization cannot successfully innovate in isolation; therefore, firms should rely on external relationships and networks in order to complement its knowledge domains, and then, develop better and faster innovations. In this sense, I would like to highlight the cross-fertilizing role of three constructs that are nurtured by different research traditions: 'collaborative/open innovation', from Strategy and Innovation Management research; 'absorptive capacity', from 'A Knowledge-Based View'; and 'market orientation', from Marketing research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Design/methodology/approach – The authors conceptualize AC within the supply chain context as four processes: knowledge acquisition from customers, knowledge acquisition from suppliers, knowledge assimilation, and knowledge application. The authors then propose and empirically test a model on the relationships among AC processes and MCC using structural equation modeling and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. Findings – The results show that AC significantly improves MCC. In particular, knowledge sourced from customers and suppliers enhances MCC in three ways: directly, indirectly through knowledge application, and indirectly through knowledge assimilation and application. The study also finds that knowledge acquisition significantly enhances knowledge assimilation and knowledge application, and that knowledge assimilation leads to knowledge application. Originality/value – This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of AC processes on MCC. It also indicates the relationships among AC processes. Moreover, it reveals the mechanisms through which knowledge sourced from customers and suppliers contributes to MCC development, and demonstrates the importance of internal knowledge management practices in exploiting knowledge from supply chain partners. Furthermore, it provides guidelines for executives to decide how to manage supply chain knowledge and devote their efforts and resources in absorbing new knowledge for MCC development. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The term counter-knowledge has been used to refer to knowledge created from unverified sources. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between counter-knowledge and human capital (HC) as well as investigating interactions between absorptive capacity (ACAP) and HC. Design/methodology/approach – A model is tested to examine the relationship between counter-knowledge, HC and the financial performance of 112 companies listed on the Spanish Stock Exchange. Findings – The results are calculated using structural equation modelling. This leads to the main conclusion that while the increasing presence of counter-knowledge leads to a reduction of ACAP and, by extension with HC. However, in the context of the sample, HC has positive effects on firms’ performance. Therefore, consideration must be given to the evaluation of the real cost of counter-knowledge or inappropriate assumptions on HC. Practical implications – The key managerial implication of this paper is that management should actively develop an organizational culture which questions the source of any knowledge and favours evidence-based reasoning over reasoning based on “gut instinct”, what has worked in the past and reasoning based on rumours and gossip. Originality/value – This paper provides empirical support for the argument that the all so-called “knowledge” generated from the sharing of unverified news is not necessarily good knowledge. Rumours or gossip shared thanks to unverified sources are some examples that illustrate people possibility to create inappropriate or false beliefs via unsupported explanations and justifications. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The studies started by Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990) appeared to pique the interest of science on the construct ""absorptive capacity of knowledge"" as one of the fundamental processes of organizational learning. Research on the subject has grown since the 90s Many studies continue to seek further discussions and empirical research on the organizational ability to identify, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge of the internal and external environment aimed at collective learning. It should be noted that the publications on the absorptive capacity of knowledge range from the individual level to the level of entire nations. Given this context, the objective of this work is to identify which internal and external factors that influence the absorption capacity of knowledge focused on innovation. As for the methodology it is literature, qualitative approach and descriptive. This is why we held an integrative literature review, with the help of a bibliographic manager, coupled with a search directed to authors and terms. The results were identified fifteen internal factors and external nine. Internal factors relate to the continuous acquisition, distribution and use of relevant knowledge within the company. External factors are those which, although external to the company, when in contact, increase organizational capacity to absorb knowledge. Also identified the importance of the process of opening up to external sources of knowledge as an important element to assess the innovative potential of the organization. One of the important considerations in the analysis relates to the role of the capabilities captured by the intensity of research and development efforts, and highly qualified personnel (traditional AC notion) and the ability to interact and access external sources of knowledge (enhanced CA) in innovative performance. This points to the need to develop internal capabilities (technological and human) in conjunction with networking capabilities and use of external sources of knowledge and information in order to produce added value and innovation. Based on in-depth analysis carried out in the revised literature, it concluded that companies can manage and develop the CA through the implementation of different methods that encourage the sharing and transfer of organizational and inter-intra knowledge."

Hence, we observe that social media are boundary-spanning tools that can be used to build and increase companies' absorptive capacity. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

We argue that ‘scientific absorptive capacity’ at the startup is critical for reaping the benefits from university research alliances, but not necessarily for other university connections. We also estimate the aggregate employment contribution from startup firms and attribute those employment gains to university research alliances and other university connections. We find significant contributions to employment growth from university research alliances and other university connections, but scientific absorptive capacity is critical for university research alliances. Only 7% of the startup population maintained a university research alliance, but among these firms, 3.4% of their total jobs created were attributable to their alliances. These results suggest that university connections are quite important for job growth and university research alliances contributed substantially to job creation for those firms that had such alliances. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the literature, a theoretical framework and relevant hypotheses are established so as to show associated relationships between shipping knowledge, absorptive capacity, and organizational innovation and logistics value. Data are collected for an empirical analysis and a moderated hierarchical regression analysis is conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings - Results show that a high level of shipping knowledge has a positive influence on the organizational innovation and logistics value of shipping companies.

The empirical analysis is based on firm level data obtained by a telephone survey in early 2010 among more than 200 non–R&D–intensive firms and 88 firms with a high R&D–intensity in the German manufacturing industry. The results show that there is surprisingly little difference in the level of AC between R&D–intensive and non–R&D–intensive firms – if the firm specific relevance of such external impulses is being taken into consideration. This is a surprising finding in so far, as it indicates that R&D intensity might not be a limiting factor for firm’s ability to recognize and implement scientific knowledge per se. Thereby, the findings presented in this chapter underline the necessity to further improve and supplement the measurement concept of firms’ AC beyond their mere R&D intensity by taking into account the strategic importance of different types of external knowledge. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

We also examine the relative importance and significance of ‘intentional unlearning’ as a bridge between ‘relational capital’ and ‘T-knowledge’ and the existence and enhancement of relational capital. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 125 Portuguese companies. Portugal is facing an extremely difficult economic situation and thousands of jobs have been lost. As a result, the ability for organisations to create, transfer, assemble, integrate and use relational capital as leverage is fundamental to achieving a competitive advantage or, indeed, survival. Associação Empresarial da Região do Algarve (NERA) is a non-profit organisation of an inter-sectoral nature associated with the Portuguese Industrial Association representing the Algarve. Analysis of the data indicates that if the organisation considers the establishment of a stock of T-knowledge as a prior step to the enhancement of unlearning, then unlearning has a positive influence on the conditions that stimulate the enhancement of relational capital. Our main conclusion is that creation of relational capital by NERA members will depend to a significant extent on how managers acquire, analyse, interpret, and understand new external knowledge.

The authors integrate the concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP) with the CSSP literature and derive two new antecedents of ACAP, trust and goal interdependency, with relevance to this context. This work responds to a call from ACAP scholars to consider the construct in alternative settings and from collaboration scholars to employ strategy research that approaches CSSPs from a viewpoint beyond a mere transactional approach. Design/methodology/approach – This manuscript presents a thorough analysis of the process literature regarding CSSPs and the construct of ACAP to consider the importance of knowledge sharing and participatory decision making in the success of collaboration efforts. The combination of these research streams results in a refined model of ACAP to be used in the CSSP context. Findings – This manuscript provides conceptual and theoretical insights into how knowledge is acquired and exploited within CSSPs. A model for ACAP in CSSPs is proposed and suggests that two new antecedents of ACAP, trust and goal interdependence, be explored in this context through subsequent empirical research. Research limitations/implications – This type of conceptual work can benefit greatly from subsequent empirical research to test the developed propositions. This model shows considerable promise for future testing, however, and has the potential to encourage additional research into knowledge sharing and long-term success of cross-sector collaborations. Practical implications – This paper fulfills the need to apply a strategic lens to CSSPs and invites future research into the mutual organizational benefits derived from collaborations that cross economic sectors. It suggests that internal organizational mechanisms exist to be developed by managers that have the potential to enhance a firms ability to recognize the value of external knowledge, acquire it, and transform it for commercial and/or social objectives. Social implications – As collaborations across economic sectors are proving vital for addressing complex social needs, this manuscript provides a new model to serve as a guidepost for successful partnerships. Originality/value – This manuscript fulfills a need to integrate strategy scholarship with CSSPs that transcends the heretofore transactional perspective.

This paper aims to open up the black box of IT-enabled absorptive capacity by theorizing and testing the role of IT in two organizational learning processes, which are either interactive with partners in the knowledge alliance or non-interactive with others in the knowledge network. In particular, we formulate a model explaining how a firm's IT investment moderates its organizational learning processes in knowledge alliances and networks, which sheds light on the role of IT as an enabler of absorptive capacity. Using a panel data set from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, the results show the moderating role of IT in strengthening the organizational learning processes from knowledge alliance experience to coinvented knowledge and from knowledge network centrality to assimilated knowledge, which, in turn, improve firm competitiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Environmental scanning systems should enable them to focus earlier on emerging threats and opportunities. A lack of applicability means that concepts often go unused in practice. But what does applicability mean for environmental scanning systems design? Adhering to the design science paradigm, this article contributes to better information systems (IS) design by developing a systematic list approach to requirements criteria that specify the applicability of environmental scanning systems. The criteria are derived from the principle of economic efficiency, use findings from the absorptive capacity theory, and can be applied to both evaluate existing environmental scanning systems and develop a new, more applicable generation. The findings should also be applicable to other IS domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

However, research on how firms' co-production enhances innovation is scarce. Thus, this study not only integrates the three dimensions of social capital and examines these dimensions' separate effects on co-production but also incorporates the roles of absorptive capacity and self-efficacy, analyzing their effect on innovation. This study uses a random sampling method to select 221 firms in Taiwan and employs structural equations modeling to test the relationships. The findings indicate that absorptive capacity and self-efficacy enhance innovation. Co-production positively affects innovation, absorptive capacity, and self-efficacy. The findings also support positive relationships between social capital and co-production.

This study is an attempt to revisit this topic, with a particular focus on large firms, which tend to have more capabilities to undertake diversified technological projects. In a sample of 165 S&P manufacturing firms with data taken into use in 2008, the results show that large firms can benefit from a diversified technological portfolio with regard to both financial and innovation performances. In addition, the relationship between technological diversity and firm performance is found to be strengthened by firms' internal and external contextual factors, namely absorptive capacity and environmental dynamism. Overall, this study not only proves the importance of technological diversity in large firms, but also provides evidence for the moderating effects of absorptive capacity and environmental dynamism. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

An alliance can be formed with younger technology start-ups to facilitate the internal innovation process of financial services providers. On the one hand, dealing with new knowledge (e.g., technological) requires an organisational capability (i.e., absorptive capacity) and the financial services provider's social capital also contributes to a successful knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, organisational learning mechanisms are also paramount in acquiring new knowledge during the innovation process since they drive a company's absorptive capacity. This paper will explore the under-researched organisational learning mechanisms during an alliance in the financial services sector. In particular the influences of policy and structural learning mechanisms on the social capital constituents (i.e., social interactions, relationship quality and supplier network ties) should be interesting areas for further exploration and a first measurement construct will be proposed in this conceptual paper.

Using survey questionnaire data from senior executives in firms collaborating with university research centres our focus was AEK with respect to advancing new products, new processes, and improvements to existing products and processes. Results show that a more technologically uncertain environment is positively associated with AEK and the firm age is associated with AEK in a curvilinear, inverted U-shape fashion such that as firms mature they apply external knowledge better up to a certain point until diminishing returns come into play. We also found tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge moderate these relationships in different ways. We conclude with implications for future theory development, empirical research, and management practice. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

The results of a survey of 248 Spanish industrial high-tech firms show that whereas the use of these mechanisms positively moderates the relationship between knowledge acquisition from suppliers and competitors and new product development, they negatively moderate the effect of knowledge acquisition from universities and have no effect on knowledge acquired from customers. On the other hand, the use of these devices negatively moderates the relationship between knowledge acquisition from suppliers and novelty of new products, and has no effect on the knowledge acquired from customers, competitors and universities. Moreover, knowledge acquisition from universities has a direct negative effect on novelty.

Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory approach was adopted using three case organizations representing different sectors. These organizations represent the public, the semi-government, and the private sectors. Findings - The findings show that proactive knowledge transfer builds the requisite absorptive capacity of users to understand, adopt new and complex systems and technologies, and effectively integrate them into their organizations, hence increasing their likelihood of adopting such innovations. The findings also show that effective user development hinges on proper selection of potential users and on goals alignment between the innovating firm and the selected users. Research limitations/implications - The framework could be further refined through more diverse case studies from a broader range of companies. Survey-based investigations are also needed to operationalize the constructs and explore its effects on the performance of the innovating firm. In practice, innovation managers should be more proactive by recognizing the value of knowledge transfer when it comes to expanding and accelerating the adoption and diffusion of their innovations. Originality/value - This paper illustrates the importance of proactive knowledge transfer, especially in situation that call for absorptive capacity building. This paper also opens new opportunities for innovation managers to sell their innovations faster and to a wider market, and perhaps even altering the trajectory of particular innovations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, many scholars discuss sustainability from an operational or administrative perspective, largely neglecting the role of individuals making up the organisation. Central to organisational development are the learning processes of these individuals and how these translate into organisational learning. Although research into organisational learning is abundant, relatively little is known about how construction organisations, particularly those classified as SMEs, undergo learning processes in order to increase their knowledge. Furthermore, organisational learning requires high absorptive capacities (ACAP) and previous research has linked this with successful standard implementation. SMEs are often pressurised by customers to obtain certification to multiple standards, yet often lack the necessary expertise, and financial and time resources to implement these. This research argues that organisational learning is a key limiting factor in successful sustainability standard implementation. Specifically, the development phase of a sustainability self-assessment tool to identify environmental and social aspects most relevant to an organisation's operations is presented. Following this, the tool then enables the level of organisational knowledge held about each of these aspects to be determined such that learning approaches are informed to increase learning and knowledge and hence absorptive capacities. The main components of this assessment tool are presented and rules for its operation and development established. Next steps for the assessment framework and suggestions for its applicability to construction product manufacturers are also offered."

However, both types of solutions still treat host-country customers as external to the theory. We highlight the role of customers in the international professional business service setting and argue that customer involvement is positively related to the perceived internationalization performance of multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs with managers who perceive higher legitimacy pressures and greater needs for local knowledge tend to undertake greater efforts to build customer involvement. Furthermore, we develop a configuration framework between perceived strategic needs and MNCs' capabilities. Specifically, MNCs that match relational capability with legitimacy needs and absorptive capacity with knowledge needs are more likely to engage in customer involvement. Our survey of 175 Chinese MNCs provides evidence that customer involvement is positively related to perceived internationalization performance. When MNCs' relational capabilities are stronger, the positive relationship between legitimacy pressure and customer involvement increases. By contrast, MNCs with greater perceived market ambiguity improve customer involvement only when they have stronger absorptive capacity. We conclude that MNCs may simultaneously reduce legitimacy and efficiency costs through customer involvement after considering the fit between perceived environmental pressures and firm capabilities. © 2015 Academy of International Business."

Applying an absorptive capacity lens, this paper develops and empirically tests an integrative model linking external knowledge acquisition (EKA) with supply chain and product innovation flexibilities, and examines the moderating effect of organisational awareness (OA) (a form of individual knowledge base) on these constructs. It is one of a select few papers that explores the effect of both internal capability and external knowledge on innovation flexibility, and discusses both supply chain and human resource development implications. Results indicate that supply chain network flexibility and information spanning flexibility play a mediating role between EKA and product innovation flexibility (PIF), illustrating the importance of flexible supply chain networks and information distribution structures in facilitating the transformation of external knowledge into innovation. The study provides further evidence that strong OA allows firms to leverage external knowledge and supply chain network capability to influence PIF and performance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

The results show that a higher level of AI leads to better performance. A firm with a diversified technological portfolio (TP) is thus likely to achieve higher degrees of AI as well as see better firm performance.

Direct grants and tax incentives are two different public instruments used to correct market failure and facilitate innovation through lowering the cost of R&D. Although large and small firms innovate in different ways, so far limited empirical evidence has been reported with respect to the effectiveness of public R&D instruments for SMEs. Our data suggests that direct subsidies used alone or with tax incentives strengthen the R&D orientation of the SME as well as some aspects of innovation output and absorptive capacity. Although the effects of policy measures are significant when comparison is made to firms that did not use any of the two instruments, not much difference is found when users of direct grants are compared to those who used both the grants and the tax incentives. This result indicates the existence of limitations in the use of tax incentives by SMEs, and thus suggests that subsidies may be the primary instrument in SMEs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

A two-dimensional framework is proposed: the learning stage (exploration, assimilation, exploitation) and the learning facet (structural, cultural, psychological and policy). Supply chain management (SCM) practices are examined in light of this framework and propositions for further empirical research are developed. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 60 empirical papers from the major journals on supply chain relationships published over an 11-year time span (2000-2010) were systematically analyzed. Findings - The paper reveals a comprehensive set of best practices and identifies four gaps for future research. First, assimilation and exploitation are largely ignored as mediating learning stages between exploration and performance. Second, knowledge brokers and reputation management are key mechanisms that foster assimilation. Third, the iteration from exploitation back to exploration is critical though underdeveloped in efficiency seeking supply chains. Fourth, the literature stresses structural mechanisms of learning, at the expense of a more holistic view of structural, cultural, psychological and policy mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - The search could be extended to other journals that report on joint learning and innovation. Practical implications - The framework provides guidelines for practitioners to develop learning capabilities and leverage the knowledge from supply chain partners in order to continuously or radically improve boundary spanning processes and products. Originality/value - The study is multi-disciplinary; it applies a model developed by learning scholars to the field of SCM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This study examines the role of external technology acquisition to investigate whether external technology acquisition is complementary or substitutive to internal R&D activities in creating innovation. The results show that external technology acquisition has an inverted U-shaped relationship with subsequent technology innovation performance, and that is not complementary to internal R&D activities. We thus confirm that external technology acquisition has to be seen as a double-edged sword and that managers need to be aware of the potentially negative effects of strong diversity of the firm's external technology acquisition sources on internal R&D and subsequent innovation performance. © 2015, The Author(s).

New knowledge should be created to develop new practices, competences and capabilities to overcome these challenges. Studies that characterise knowledge creation as a transformation process through the networks of social relationships and intra-organisational teams are needed to understand, and thus improve such processes in project environments. Structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of Social Capital (SC) influence the utilisation of knowledge creation opportunities inherent in project networks. Hence, SC provides the essential infrastructure for knowledge creation. A fresh approach to operationalising the concept of SC through social network analysis and content analysis is thus required. This paper develops and explores the conceptual relationships between knowledge creation and SC in the context of two live building projects. There are two main conclusions. First, structural network indices are indicators of knowledge creation opportunities but they should be considered in conjunction with the relational and cognitive dimensions to determine whether and how opportunities are being utilised. Second, project communication strategies should be designed to enable actors in structurally advantageous positions for knowledge creation to utilise these opportunities. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."

Therefore, enterprises have to develop the optimal strategy that can effectively and directly increase the product innovation performance (PIP) while considering the changing pace and innovation dynamics of their industries. Although previous research revealed innovation factors that affect product innovation, few research has considered the direct influence of the factors on PIP with considering the differences of the relative importance of the factors according to the product innovation cycle time. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors directly affecting on PIP and compare the relative importance of the factors in dynamic and non-dynamic environment. To this end, we conducted ordinary least square regression analysis using an empirical data extracted from Korea Innovation Survey 2010. Regression results reveal that some factors are only effective for the dynamic environment while some factors affect both environments."

This study contributes to the empirical literature by investigating foreign direct investment (FDI) as a channel of productivity growth in MENA oil and non-oil-producing countries. To illustrate the link between FDI, technological catch-up, and host-country labor productivity growth, we present a simple theoretical model. Using a cross-sectionally correlated and timewise autoregressive (CCTA) model, our panel data regression results show that FDI spillovers are insignificant in oil and non-oil-producing countries during the period 1992-2008, whereas technological catch-up significantly affects labor productivity growth in these countries. Two aspects can explain these results. First, local firms' competitive capabilities in MENA countries are relatively weak. Second, most FDIs to oil and non-oil-producing countries are low-quality FDI, which flows to extractive and natural resource-based sectors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

It is expected that owners of SMEs will develop contracts for non-ownermanagers or monitoring practices that align the interests of agents and principals. As a result of interest alignment, the relationships between entrepreneurial orientation, views on intangible resources, focus on performance metrics and satisfaction with overall financial performance should be similar for owner- and non-owner-managers of SMEs. The study results show differences in risk-taking behaviour and views of resource development between owner-managers and non-owner-managers. However, a strong relationship between short-term performance and overall satisfaction with financial performance existed in the sample of both owner-managers and non-owner-managers."

In this research, we examine the deployment of the open innovation model in resource-based industries through the case of the Canadian oil and gas sector. Our findings show that the need for technical innovation is rapidly increasing as a result of the nature of the new complex fossil fuel reservoirs the industry is now developing. High research and development costs, long development cycles, resistance to change and high technical risk, we find, are obstacles hindering the development of new innovative technologies. In response to these challenges to innovation, the Canadian industry experimented with a unique model of open innovation by establishing an industry-level organisation. In this study, we explore this emerging model of open innovation and interpret its successes and failures through the use of the theoretical literature. The conceptual model that we derive combines strategic bridging organisational concepts with open innovation ideas to help us understand the building of an innovative technologies network at the industry level.

The firms have an international flair and they rapidly globalise their operations. Their strategic intent is to develop unique innovative capabilities through networking. In science-based industries such as the biotechnology sector the ability to innovate can only occur if a firm is able to both generate and integrate knowledge from inside and outside its boundaries. In that respect, this article employs a multi-case approach to construct a frame of reference for developing innovative capabilities that complement firm-based competences. The main focus is on small born-global bio-tech firms in the East Midlands region of the UK. The newly developed framework is invaluable to researchers, small born-global bio-tech and large bio-pharmaceutical firms. More so, it contributes to the concepts of dynamic capabilities and networking. Copyright ©2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

When is innovation negative? What are the damaging effects of innovation? In this article, it is argued that innovation has negative impacts on organizational performance when the newly introduced knowledge is not compatible with an organization’s prior knowledge. In this instance, an organization may experience knowledge loss or organizational dysfunctions, such as avoidance, resistance, struggle, alteration, and conversion processes. To avoid the negative impacts of innovation, we suggest that organizations should first recognize the incompatibility between the new knowledge and prior knowledge and then reformulate the newly introduced knowledge.

"The learning dynamics of external-internal knowledge and exploitation-exploration: The case of SMEs' learning-capacity building","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959280011&partnerID=40&md5=d674c2ff9699da5a05c7dd157615502b","The research aims to explain the degree of complementarity, interdependency and co-evolution within the process of knowledge integration and learning and over the firm's technological trajectory. In doing so, it searches for the process of capacity building, emphasizing the interaction between knowledge reconfiguration and its orientation. Three bodies of literature frame the analysis. First, from the literature on knowledge management the main problems of coordination regarding knowledge transfer are discussed. Second, publications on both organizational learning and dynamic capability are considered together to enable the firm's learning dynamics to be understood by distinguishing the mechanisms, the processes and methods used by firms to develop common ground in their interpretative system. Lastly, the absorptive capacity construct is examined in terms of the different levels at which the firm approaches external knowledge and develops its learning experience. Accordingly, taking a process and micro view of learning, the analytical approach emphasizes the learning schemes, defined as the vehicles through which the action of mobilizing component knowledge into capabilities and routines occurs. Based on their differences and similarities regarding knowledge source and orientation, these learning schemes define six categories of learning capacity: formative, adaptive, transformative, inventive, created and renewed. The way these learning capacities are developed over time defines the firm's learning trajectory, presenting a functional relationship with its technological trajectory. The research deployed a historical in-depth two-case-study method. The first case is a nursery seedling firm (NSF) within the fruit industry and the second case supplies ingredients for the food industry (ISF). The data was taken from annual review reports and project documents combined with semi-structured interviews with key individuals of the firms. The cases provide evidence of the firms' learning-capacity building and co-evolution of their knowledge-integration and learning system (KILS). The evidence show that what really matters is how firms develop, at a certain point, a simultaneous and complementary interaction among these learning capacities. This process creates what are defined as a 'sense of opportunity' and 'technological flexibility'. Moreover, the evidence reveals that the oscillation between 'path-dependent' and 'path-breaking' changes is not linear along the trajectory. Thus, a rather complementary and iterative dynamic between the six learning capacities throughout the learning trajectory and technological trajectory is exhibited. The contributions of this research are relevant to firms categorized as established engineering-based SMEs within market contexts identified as 'moderately dynamic' with disperse and erratic 'technological opportunities'.

This research seeks to examine absorptive capacity and its four capabilities of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation and their impact on effective knowledge management. All of these capabilities are strategies that enable external knowledge to be recognized, imported and integrated into, and further developed within the organization effectively. The research tests the relationships between absorptive capacity and effective knowledge management through analysis of quantitative data (n = 549) drawn from managers and employees in 35 residential aged care organizations in Western Australia. Responses were analysed using Partial Least Square-based Structural Equation Modelling. Additional analysis was conducted to assess if the job role (of manager or employee) and three industry context variables of profit motive, size of business and length of time the organization has been in business, impacted on the hypothesized relationships."

However, knowledge shared in an online community represents only a potential for firm’s innovation aims. The effectiveness of exploration and exploitation of this knowledge depends on firm’s absorptive capacity. In this work the authors focus on the time an idea, shared within an online community, takes to be transformed from a ‘potential’ into a ‘realized’ innovation by a firm. In particular, conceiving knowledge as a trajectory across pole of attraction rather than a linear process, the authors develop a model inspired by the solar system metaphor. Preliminary results from a case study are presented. They suggest firms may improve the effectiveness of absorptive capacity exploiting the mediation role of a software tool. © 2015 by IGI Global.

Our results indicate that knowledge-related effects such as absorptive capacity, technological distance and knowledge-base modularity are significant determinants of network evolution. Moreover, transitivity is found to be a relevant endogenous structural effect.

Two channels are analyzed namely import and international student flows. The empirical results based on generalized method-of-moment system estimation on a panel of 75 developing countries show that spillover effects through import and international student flow are significant, but the latter channel appear to be more important in term of magnitude. This finding is consistent with view that technology diffusion via human capital mobility should not be underestimated. More importantly, the finding reveals that countries with higher level of economic freedom benefit more from R & D spillovers. This provides further support to the idea that successful knowledge acquisition requires absorptive capacity."

In the second step, we investigate the impact on innovation performance of knowledge exploration versus knowledge exploitation. We obtain a clear pattern of the differences between firms that are engaged both in exploitative and explorative activities (‘exploration’-oriented firms) and purely ‘exploitation’-oriented firms. We find that exploration-oriented firms have a greater knowledge absorptive capacity, are technologically more diverse and are strongly exposed to intensive non-price competition compared with exploitation-oriented firms. We further find a positive effect on innovation performance for exploitation-oriented firms but not for those that were exploration oriented. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

On the other hand, an innovative startup faces (and bears the associated risks of) liabilities of newness and smallness that exceed those of its non-innovative counterparts. The available empirical literature addressing this theoretical tension mostly supports the former hypothesis; we suggest that this finding is, in part, driven by the common practice of employing an ex post measure that already embodies a degree of success in innovativeness. We use an ex ante measure and find that a startup's innovativeness is negatively associated with its subsequent survival. We also find that entrepreneurs' greater appetite for risk magnifies this negative association. These findings imply that pursuing innovations is not necessarily associated with survival during the early stages of firm development and entails a more complicated start-up process. © 2014."

Sustainable innovation can be broadly defined as an innovation that has to consider environmental and social issues as well as the needs of future generations. Although sustainable innovation provides considerable new opportunities for companies it goes along with an increased complexity. This in turn requires certain organizational routines and capabilities to deal with the upcoming challenges. We explore what the specific driving forces are that increase the degree of sustainable innovation within a firm's innovation activities. We test them empirically for more than 1,100 firms in Germany and find that firms need to invest in internal absorptive capacities and to draw both broadly and deeply from external sources for innovation. In that sense, investments in employee training turn out to be more important than technological R&D expenditures.

We introduce two main novelties: in the first place, we include the FDI variable, dividing it between types of foreign investor (industrial versus financial) besides the analysis with the division by country of origin. Second, we analyse whether FDIs may have effects not only on the probability that a firm exits from the domestic market, but also on whether it stops being internationally involved, that is, whether it stops importing or exporting. We find that German firms, in most cases, suffer from higher competition introduced by foreign firms except when they are part of a high-R&D region or a high-tech sector, because they have enough absorptive capacity to take advantage of possible spillover effects. We also find that US FDIs have a crowding out effect for firms located in low-tech sectors but not in high-tech sectors. The results are reversed when considering financial investments instead of industrial investments. Finally, we find that FDIs are negatively correlated with exits from export markets but positively with those from import markets. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The paper points out how the ethnic and economic reasons for conflict influence this interaction that creates barriers in the knowledge management processes in an organization. Theoretical model is predicated on two structural dimensions of ethnicity: ethnic boundary and ethnic competition, which are then related to the national cultural values of individualism, masculinity, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance. The cultural values of long-term versus short-term orientation and indulgence versus restraint are not included in the conceptualization as the first one is rarely used because of its inclination toward Confucian ethic, whereas the second is found to be more or less complementary to long-term versus short-term orientation. In the paper, prejudice and limited absorptive capacity are identified as the first-level effects, which, consequentially, produce the barriers of knowledge hoarding and knowledge stickiness during the course of knowledge transference in an organization. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Using firm-level data from Chinese customs over the 2000-6 period, we investigate the relationship between the export performance of firms and how their products relate to local comparative advantage. Our key indicator measures the density of the links between a product and the local product space. Hence, it combines information on the intrinsic relatedness of a good with information on the local pattern of specialization. Our results indicate that exports grow faster for goods that have denser links with those currently produced in the firm's locality. The density of links between products seems to yield export-enhancing spillovers. However, we show that this positive effect of product relatedness on export performance is mainly limited to ordinary trade activities and domestic firms. It is also stronger for more productive firms, suggesting that spillover diffusion may be hindered by insufficient absorptive capacity. JEL codes: F10, F14, O14. © The Author 2013.

Based upon a review of the absorptive capacity and knowledge management literature, we defined knowledge acquisition as the change in the collective knowledge of groups over time. The amount of individual prior knowledge, and common knowledge among group members, managerial practices, and perceptions of knowledge applicability were identified as independent variables. Data were collected from 179 individuals representing 28 work groups in 7 public-sector organizations. Using multi-level regression, we found that homogeneity of knowledge at the group level and perceptions of knowledge applicability influenced acquisition, but that, contrary to much of the literature in this domain, prior-related knowledge did not have such an influence. Middle-management practices moderated the impact of knowledge applicability, suggesting that middle managers provide contextual information that permits group members to better understand the relevance of external knowledge. Implications for practice include the importance of training staff in teams to build homogeneity of knowledge, and ensuring that middle managers understand the organization's strategy and their roles in the knowledge-utilization process. Implications for theory include the notion that prior knowledge can either encourage or obstruct knowledge acquisition. © 2015 The Author."

This paper analyzes the birth and evolution of an Italian innovation community created by a group of SMEs searching for innovation. Coming from quite different fields, these SMEs converged around a challenging project in the field of biomedical and rehabilitation devices. The aim of the paper is twofold: (1) to investigate what type of competences and tasks have to be accomplished to effectively manage an innovation community (IC) and what managerial roles (promotors) emerge by crossing competences and tasks; and (2) to what extent community members' absorptive capacity (ACAP) influences their ability to acquire and exploit innovation generated by the community. Using an in-depth longitudinal case study analysis, we identified three different stages in community evolution. We also studied which promotors' roles that emerged in each stage and determined their relationship both between each other and to community performance. Furthermore, we investigated to what extent an existing knowledge base in a specific domain and previous experiences in networking influenced community members' ability to exploit innovation. We found that a specific correspondence among competences and tasks is needed to guarantee community performance and that promotors should interact among themselves to enable the community to reach its goal. Concerning ACAP, we found that prior experience and familiarity in networking are not predictive of new knowledge exploitation. © 2014 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Presenting new goods, commodities or services mostly requires the expenditure of huge amount of both financial and human resources which, in turn, can endanger the company’s status in the market if it fails to fulfill the product requirements. In this way, firms increasingly realize that a flexible workforce helps mitigate downside risks and offers opportunities for achieving superior and innovative performance. Therefore, considering flexible investing plan such as real options reasoning can be regarded as one of top priority for innovative firms. In this regard, the primary and major question of the study will be whether real options reasoning or thinking as a strategy for uncertainty reduction matter when innovative firms are looking to increase their rate of radical and incremental innovative performance in rapidly changing and unpredictable environments? Through a comprehensive literature review, we will attempt to find out whether adaptive capability exercises a mediating role between real options reasoning and innovative performance? Also, the capacity of firms to create and exploit new knowledge is critical for innovative outputs. In other words, a firm’s innovation performance is an outcome of increases in its knowledge base and the success of real options thinking mostly depends on organizational ability to evaluate and utilize outside information and knowledge. Thus we will investigate the moderate effects of absorptive capacity on the relationship between real options thinking and innovative performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

Design/methodology/approach - Expatriate labour is viewed as a form of contingent employment that provides firms with ready access to experienced and specialised knowledge. We argue that in a knowledge economy, the successful use of workplace quotas for nationals depends on effective management of both nationals and non-nationals. By drawing on scholarly contributions in the areas of strategic management, agency theory, knowledge management and absorptive capacity, this paper consolidates extant knowledge and proposes a new framework aimed at developing a more integrated agenda for future research. Findings - Three broad categories are posited as strategic enablers to effective knowledge management. First, senior leadership has a direct role in developing appropriate policies, promoting transparency and fostering a culture of trust and an indirect role through the establishment of incentives. Second, the influence of incentives on both knowledge management and process improvement is addressed. Third, the characteristics of each group with regard to qualifications, motivation and receptivity are discussed. Optimally, these factors work in concert to build competencies that ultimately satisfy customers and meet organisational goals. Originality/value - There is a gap in scholarly research that explicitly links important organisational and management concepts to the study of expatriate-national interactions. This article contributes to understanding how policy makers and leaders can strengthen the transformative forces that will drive successful development of human capital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This paper is proposing a model that will ensure the continuous participation of Nigerian automobile component manufacturing SMEs in the local and global automobile value chain. This paper draws on literature survey coupled with semi-structured interview with managers in automobile assemble firms that work with some local automobile component part supply firms in Nigeria Findings show progress made by SMEs in different sector through the process of Open innovation (OI), however there is still a divide on the use of open innovation in the automotive sector. One of the subsidiaries of a European multinational automobile companies surveyed in this study stated several local suppliers who could not fit in its supply chain when it introduced car models that were on different technology platforms. The fast integration & development of Mechatronics and material science in the automobile industry was disruptive for the Nigerian firms, even though some of these firms attempted to source for technology abroad to stay in business. There are question marks on the business strategies, absorptive capacities of these firms and also on the national support infrastructure. The model being proposed is suitable one for SMEs in the automobile component manufacturing in Nigeria. This paper concludes by stating that networking of SMEs into the global value chain remains an open innovation approach for SMEs in Nigeria and as a good learning mechanism, considering the structure of the innovation system found in most developing countries.

Albeit the exact gains obtained from FDI are difficult to measure, their benefitial developmental impact has been evidenced by both the ensuing accelerated structural adaptation and higher levels of technological performance achieved across the V4 countries. FDI has ameliorated the areas of total factor productivity growth and export performance, rendering as well the market environment of the economies observed much more regular. FDI as a vehicle of acceleration of economic growth has contributed to the narrowing of the performance gap between the V4 grouping and the ""old"" EU member states. The first part of the article is, therefore, focused on the creation of conditions making for FDI inflow to the V4 countries. At the beginning of the economic transition, the FDI inflow to the V4 economies was predominantly dependent on their ability to secure favourable business environment and conditions required for the free movement of international capital. The second part of the paper seeks to compare FDI inflows to the V4 countries during the pre- and post-crisis periods. The upward impact of FDI stock on the economic growth throughout the V4 countries is then estimated by means of a growth accounting method. Lastly, we address the relationship between the technological level and absorptive capacity of the economies under scrutiny, with an eye to the potential impact of FDI on innovation-related performance growth. © 2015, Technical University of Budapest.

Finally, it indicates how such interactions can facilitate the transition from potential to realised absorptive capacity. The article interrogates the incubation process by using the absorptive capacity framework to evaluate how it might strengthen the business model of new technology firms. The qualitative findings suggest that where founders, advisers, mentors and incubator directors engage collaboratively to create an iterative dialogue which informs the development of a viable business model, the process by which potential absorptive capacity can be fully realised is substantially strengthened. © The Author(s) 2013."

In addition, the study explores whether these capabilities increase firm performance and also examines the relationship between relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a partial least squares analysis using data collected from 115 firms. The results demonstrate that firms enhanced their relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity by leveraging their physical and human IT resources invested in interorganizational relationships and that these two capabilities increased their performance. Moreover, our results indicate that relationship-specific memory served as a knowledge base for the development of absorptive capacity. The results offer empirical evidence on how firms could improve their performance by internally managing the relational knowledge obtained through their interorganizational relationships. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

We also draw from outward knowledge transfer and expatriate learning perspectives to address the cyclical nature of the process. As such, we include the effect of expatriate learning not only in continued knowledge flows to the subsidiary, but also in knowledge flows to the home division. We offer several implications for research on practice, including the notion that knowledge transfer to the subsidiary should continue upon repatriation, and that outward knowledge transfer can begin before repatriation. The framework reiterates that expatriates are valuable human capital and a source of sustained competitive advantage to the MNE. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Empirical results, based on a sample of firms in the software industry, confirm this relationship. Further, empirical findings suggest shared leadership positively influences each capability of absorptive capacity (acquisition, assimilation, and transformation) with the exception of the exploitation capability. The findings extend understanding of how shared leadership influences firm performance noting the value-creating role of the firm's absorptive capacity and demonstrate the potential for further investigating leadership forms from a capability perspective."

This chapter provides essential insights into the process steps necessary for successfully preparing for distant collaboration in cross-industry networks as well as for creating multilateral cross-industry networks. Cross-industry networks comprise an intensive exchange and development of knowledge in a process of mutual learning and adaptation through collaborative arrangements with specific innovation partners. The role of the technology managers, who identify synergic effects across the process stage of identifying potential absorptive capacity, and the function of the network managers, who act as interface between the firm and its external partners, are key for the exchange of ideas and for building expertise for the early innovation phase. Also cultural issues must be considered when implementing multilateral cross-industry networks, as processes of knowledge work beyond organizational boundaries entail organizational cognitive distance. An established network culture based on common values like trust and openness as well as shared norms, objectives and interests facilitates the sharing and transfer of knowledge. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

To apply external knowledge, they must have a distinctive capacity to absorb knowledge. One of the main influencing factors for absorptive capacity is a knowledge-friendly organizational culture, because the knowledge absorbing behavior of individuals can be better coordinated through implicit values and norms than through structural coordination instruments. When focusing on an organization's overall behavior, it is important to investigate in detail how a knowledge-friendly organizational culture influences absorptive capacity. Therefore, the author analysis the relationship between organizational culture and absorptive capacity and shows how a knowledge-friendly organizational culture should be designed to support the absorption of external knowledge in SMEs. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014.

Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions. For managers in the global marketplace, the findings lead to the suggestion that MNCs devote attention to nurturing the absorptive capacities at different organizational levels in order to optimize the global transfer of knowledge. © 2014 Academy of International Business."

This heterogeneity yields increases in organizational-level cognitive distance. Whereas recent theory suggests cognitive distance is positively related to exploratory innovation, too much distance can hinder efficient knowledge absorption and results in a reduced effect on novelty value. This paper focuses on the research question of how to build potential absorptive capacity for distant collaboration beyond established industry boundaries to gain radical rather than incremental results. To address this question, we mapped a cross-industry network using survey data on 215 bilateral cross-industry collaborations between firms from a variety of industries and captured cognitive proximity (the inverse of distance) in terms of overall knowledge redundancy between firms. This approach introduces a new method to infer organizational-level cognitive distance from network analysis. Subsequently, based on results from the network analysis, we examined coordination antecedents to potential absorptive capacity for cross-industry innovation with partners at moderate and high distance applying case study analysis. Our study revealed three alternative approaches to coordination antecedents that drive a firms potential absorptive capacity for distant collaboration. These findings extend research on absorptive capacity to the field of cross-industry innovation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Counter-knowledge may be acquired unwittingly from unreliable or inaccurate sources such as gossip, lies, exaggeration and partial truths. We consider that if counter-knowledge is present then specific actions are required to stimulate realised absorptive capacity and, hence, provide for the creation and assimilation of new knowledge and new knowledge structures. Thus, in this paper, we focus on intentional unlearning as a method to counteract the problem of counter-knowledge. We have analysed the relationships between an unlearning context and counter-knowledge using an empirical study of 164 Spanish hospitality companies in order to identify whether the impact of unlearning on RACAP can be strength. A model is tested in which counter-knowledge is simultaneously a hindrance and a challenge stressor. Our results confirm that counter-knowledge is a variable that, when controlled, has the effect of strengthening the relationship between unlearning and RACAP. However, when left uncontrolled, the relationship between unlearning and RACAP is weaker than it otherwise would be. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

More specifically, we use R&D intensity, a traditional measure of absorptive capacity, and five variables of organizational composition to measure their moderating effect between R&D outsourcing effort and the firm's resulting performance. We use a fixed-effect model to analyze panel data from 19,570 Korean manufacturing firms between 2002 and 2007. Our findings show that the intensity of R&D outsourcing in high technology industries has a direct and positive effect on a firm's performance. We also identify the differences between high- and medium/low-technology industries and analyze how having an R&D staff of highly skilled researchers can moderate the effect of R&D outsourcing on a firm's performance. We find that for high-technology industries, R&D outsourcing is strongly associated with a firm's positive performance when the ratio of researchers with Ph.D. degrees in R&D organization is high. However, in low-technology industries, our study indicates that while the ratio of researchers in R&D to R&D staff has a direct effect on firm performance, it does not actually moderate the effect of R&D outsourcing on firm performance. We provide an interpretation of these empirical findings, emphasizing the importance of a firm's absorptive capacity via organizational composition of the R&D division in maximizing R&D outsourcing results. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

To contribute to the discussion on impediments and barriers to customer integration, this authors presents a case study that examines customer integration into different stages of the NPD on the basis on three complementary learning strategies, namely explorative learning, transformative learning, and exploitative learning.

Using archival data on the career histories of designers and the creative performance of their fashion houses between 2000 and 2010, we find that a house's outward centrality in the network of personnel mobility-resulting from personnel departures-has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the house's creative performance. This relationship is moderated by the house's inward centrality in a network of personnel mobility stemming from hiring competitors' employees, the tenure of its creative directors, the accomplishments of these directors, and the house's status. Our results suggest that organizations can enhance their creativity by relying on ideas obtained through relationships with their former employees long after these employees left to work for the competition. However, this effect is contingent upon characteristics of the organization that may be associated with its capacity to absorb these ideas and its ability to signal legitimacy of the resulting output to the external audiences. © 2014 INFORMS."

Absorptive capacity studies typically test direct effects of either the transfer capacity of the strategy's initiator or the recipient's ability to process and exploit the strategy on related learning outcomes. Mixed findings allow the possibility of more complex relationships. This study examines the relationships between MNC headquarters and marketing units located in subsidiary firms using a sample of 213 marketing managers. The study systematically explores linear, interaction, and quadratic effects within a structural equation modeling paradigm. The findings indicate that the relationship between a MNC headquarters' transfer capacity and a subsidiary marketing unit's processing capacity on the strategy's exploitation is one of mediation and moderation. The subsidiary marketing unit's processing capacity is a key mediating variable and headquarters' transfer capacity moderates the effects of this variable on the exploitation of the marketing strategy by the subsidiary's unit. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

Building on the organizational learning and institutional literatures, and the concept of absorptive capacity (AC), and using a sample of Indonesian manufacturing-sector exporters we identify two dimensions of internationalization-related AC: international market and international strategic operation. Unlike previous literature, we find that indirect, or second-hand, experience contributes more than the firm's own experience to the development of international market AC. Furthermore, the second-hand experience feeds Indonesian manufacturing exporters' learning in both positive (e.g., buyers) and negative (e.g., suppliers and foreign multinationals in Indonesia) ways. In contrast, the development of international operation strategy AC appears to be driven internally, with minimal contribution from either first- or second-hand experience. We posit that these outcomes are influenced by the rapid and substantial changes in the domestic institutional environment faced by the Indonesian manufacturers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Survey-based data from 106 subsidiaries located in the U.S. suggests that local (i.e., host country) knowledge inflows to a subsidiary are more effective in enhancing a subsidiary's knowledge creation capability compared to global knowledge inflows from other units of the same MNC. Furthermore, results point to a not-invented-here syndrome in the exploitation of knowledge sourced from the parent company; such that when a subsidiary's internal social capital is high, the relationship between global knowledge inflows and knowledge creation capability is negative and when it is low, the relationship becomes positive. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

However, the emergence of the knowledge economy may enable leveraging of knowledge to address such innate limitations. The aim of this study is to twofold. First, the study explores how SMEs in peripheral areas, i.e. challenging regions, seek to implement innovation from a path perspective by examining the contributions from antecedent and mediator variables or constructs, including knowledge-based factors identified in the literature, using a cross-sectional survey of SMEs at firm level. Second, to further examine how these path model constructs and relationships contribute in a causal manner to innovation implementation at an activity level of analysis based on knowledge-based view and dynamic capability theory, using a case study analysis. Design/methodology/approach: A sequential mixed method approach is used. In relation to the first aim a hypothetical path model is tested using structured equation modelling techniques based on a cross-sectional survey of SMEs in peripheral regions (n=604). For the second aim, to further examine how the path model constructs and relationships contribute to innovation implementation in a causal manner at an activity level of analysis, an explanatory case-based approach is used based on dynamic capability theory. Findings: The findings show that at a firm level knowledge factors influence innovation implementation as mediating factors through knowledge acquisition and assimilation which is consistent with potential absorptive capacity, and knowledge sharing linkages. Antecedent factors of lifecycle, leadership, culture and historical propensity to innovation were found to interact with the mediating variables of knowledge acquisition and assimilation, TQM/business improvement and knowledge sharing linkages (external), to produce a range of innovation outputs, including knowledge transformation and sales of new products and services from innovation activities. Based on the case study findings the underlying knowledge-based dynamic capabilities which contribute to the relationships within the path model were identified and further research agendas established. Originality/value: There is a relative paucity of studies on innovation implementation within SMEs in peripheral regions using a knowledge-based perspective at firm level, as opposed to regional level (e.g. regional innovation studies). In this context unique resource limitations and the contribution of knowledge-based factors need to be addressed. This study seeks to compliment regional level studies by making a contribution at both a cross-sectional SME or firm level and at an activity level of analysis in this area and to identify areas for further research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The most common mode of strategic alliance consists of horizontal and vertical integrations. However, the study adopting absorptive capacity to examine the impacts of different R&D organization structures on the performance of firms at different alliance modes has never been discussed. Therefore, the paper employs absorptive capacity to mediate the relationships between different R&D organization structures and the performance of firms. Since the theory of transaction cost economics is inadequate for addressing how well the technological knowledge develops in the organization. A conceptual model to analyze the tension between product strategies and their strategy implementation is proposed to challenge the vacancy. Practical investigation shows that a matrix R&D organizational structure mainly transfers knowledge to input-oriented R&D organizational structures in horizontal integration, and mainly integrates capabilities from output-oriented organizational structures in vertical integration. The result implies that stronger institutional environments lead to a stronger link between product strategies and their performance in vertical integration. Oppositely, the link is strengthened if more favorable attitudes and weaker management controls are present in horizontal integrations. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Results from variance-based structural equation modeling and PROCESS tool show that RACAP fully mediates the influence of the PACAP on IO, and this indirect effect is positively conditioned by RL.

Furthermore, we lack knowledge of the interplay between an appropriability regime and absorptive capacity, although they clearly have the capacity to exert positive and negative effects both on each other and on innovativeness. This study presents findings derived from theoretical discussion and an empirical examination of 155 firms that suggest that while competitors' absorptive capacity does not play a direct negative or positive role on the innovation performance of a firm, an appropriability regime exerts a strong positive influence. Nevertheless, high rival absorptive capacity is not without importance, since the significant interaction effects suggest that a strong appropriability regime has positive effects on innovation performance especially in the context of a rival having high absorptive capacity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

In this paper, we focus on absorptive capacity of decision-makers as a critical mechanism that gives social ties their potency in explaining collaborative decision-making in an inter-organizational network (ION) context. In a sample of key individuals in 13 export consortia, this study identifies the extent to which the characteristics of personal network affect individuals’ absorptive capacity. Our results suggest that weak and heterogeneous ties between key individuals in an ION are central mechanisms that influence their ability to access, assimilate, transform and utilize information. However, indirect ties do not show a positive impact on absorptive capacity, as it was hypothesized. Our findings add to the literature on the role of network ties in collaborative decision-making by making explicit a mechanism through which personal network of individuals in an ION influence their information-processing capabilities for effective decision-making. We show that decision-making in interfirm networks is not only a political process but also a learning process. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."

Based on survey data from 198 projects in multinational companies (MNCs) in the Thai automotive industry, this research finds that HRM practices moderate the effects of a project team's knowledge ACAP on project performance, in particular of potential ACAP on long-run project performance. In addition, HRM practices covary with a project team's realized ACAP, the other dimension of ACAP, to affect short-run project performance. This research sheds light on the different roles that HRM practices play in a project, finding that HRM practices not only facilitate knowledge management from the current project to future projects but also strengthen the relationship between a project team's knowledge ACAP and long-term project performance.

This study extends previous research by showing how absorptive capacity emerges as an unintended consequence from organizational boundary spanners' external and internal relational embeddedness and their relational empowerment. Drawing upon survey data from 218 inter-organizational projects in the German engineering industry, we propose and find empirically that potential and realized absorptive capacity have partially distinct antecedents. Moreover, we show that the two components of absorptive capacity unfold not only separate but also complementary effects on innovation, implying that the whole of absorptive capacity is greater than its parts.

Among these is the limited theorising and empirical investigation of innovative practices by tourism organisations. This paper responds to these concerns by examining one important dimension of innovation within commercial tourism organisations, namely their ability to acquire, assimilate and utilise external knowledge (absorptive capacity) for competitive advantage. The topic is pertinent because there is evidence to suggest that tourism organisations are particularly dependent on external sources of knowledge when compared with businesses in other sectors. Following a discussion of the conceptual antecedents of absorptive capacity and its dimensions, a validated instrument for its measurement is developed and used to measure the absorptive capacity of the British hotel sector. The results suggest that current conceptions of absorptive capacity have limitations when applied to tourism enterprises. Absorptive capacity is re-conceptualised to overcome these deficiencies.

Furthermore, despite significant advancements in our understanding, we still know little about the way absorptive capacity actually unfolds on an organizational level, as many studies predominantly take absorptive capacity as a quantitatively measurable phenomenon. We address these two shortcomings by following recent calls for a practice perspective on absorptive capacity. In particular, we reveal the choreography of knowledge absorption practices in an interorganizational network. Based on an empirical study in the semiconductor industry, we put forward the thesis that this can be achieved by congregating, that is, repeatedly exchanging face-to-face ideas at network-wide venues such as conferences or workshops. We illustrate how a lead firm in this industry carefully choreographs congregating, which helps the organization acquire knowledge from network partners and utilize the knowledge internally. Herein, we contribute a practice perspective on how to influence organizational absorptive capacity when engaging with an interorganizational network as a distinctive organizational form. A practice lens also entails being sensitive to the political dimension of absorptive capacity. Moreover, choreographies of bundles of absorptive capacity-relevant practices represent a concept to inform future research. © The Author(s) 2013."

The results proved to be significant, with emerging enterprises' TAC generally stronger than traditional ones. Specifically, emerging enterprises have much stronger realized technology absorptive capacity (RTAC), while traditional enterprises are slightly advantageous in potential technology absorptive capacity (PTAC). The fundamental reason of traditional automobile companies' weakness in TAC, in spite of their abundant prior knowledge, is low intensity of effort and lack of input in assimilation and transformation, which is a validation of Kim's absorptive capacity model. © 2014 PICMET."

The review of the concept of absorptive capacity and a detailed study from the perspective of this new reality will be the main objective of study of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing classical absorptive capacity and absorptive capacity from the point of view of information management tools in each one of the three stages of the organizational learning cycle, some gaps of the former are overcome/fulfilled. The academic/bibliographical references provided in this paper have been obtained from ISI web of knowledge, Scopus and Dialnet data bases, supporting the state of affairs on absorptive capacity and thereafter filtering by ""Business Intelligence"" and ""Business Analytics"". Specialized websites and Business Schools' Publications there have also been included, crowning the content on information management tools used that are currently used in the strategic consulting. Findings: Our contribution to the literature is the development of ""smart absorptive capacity"". This is a new capacity emerging from the reformulation of the classical concept of absorptive capacity wherein some aspects of its definition that might have been omitted are emphasized. The result of this new approach is the creation of a new Theoretical Model of Organizational Intelligence, which aims to explain, within the framework of the Resources and Capabilities Theory, the competitive advantage achieved by the so-called smart companies. Originality/value: This paper presents a novel integration of various concepts: the concept of absorptive capacity from academic research and strategic consulting associated with the tools of information management.

Results from an international survey of 148 large organisations show that both theories explain Green IT assimilation with a medium effect size and that while contextual theory has a slightly higher R2 value than absorptive capacity, the difference is not statistically significant. We then propose a parsimonious and integrated model of Green IT assimilation drawing on contextual and absorptive capacity theories and outline implications for practitioners.

The same transformational initiative might prove effective in one health system yet not another. Variations in success also exist across facilities, departments, or other units within a healthcare organization. Such variations remain relatively unexplored in the literature. We propose that some of these variations might be due to levels of absorptive capacity (ACAP), the ability to discover and exploit innovation, across and within healthcare organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a research framework and recommend a measurement model for the study of ACAP for transformations in the healthcare setting. To develop a framework for ACAP for transformation, we reviewed 118 peer-reviewed journal articles, 36 books or book sections and two websites related to transformation and ACAP. We also reviewed literature covering related topics, including ACAP measurement models, organizational learning, organizational change, innovation, complex adaptive systems, strategy execution, organizational technologies, leadership, and culture. This comprehensive review of literature covered fields of sociology, organizational theory, management science, and systems theory. The approach sought a parsimonious framework sufficient to capture the significant complexities of ACAP for transformation in healthcare. Our proposed framework of measuring ACAP in healthcare organizations encompasses three dimensions: leadership (L), culture (C), and organizational technologies (OT) that are relevant to transformative change. By applying this LCOT framework in measuring ACAP levels associated with transformation issues, barriers, and outcomes, we propose that constraints can be identified and addressed, and successful implementation of transformational initiatives can be realized. Capturing and tracking the level of ACAP will help healthcare leaders with improving transformation implementation and success, making informed decisions about timing and selection of initiatives, and decisions about continuation or contraction of specific transformations within specific departments, teams or their healthcare system. © Common Ground, Bita Kash, Aaron Spaulding, Larry Gamm, Christopher Johnson, All Rights Reserved."

An important question then is: when is it better to cooperate? And, once the decision to cooperate is made, how can an appropriate partner be selected? In this paper we present a model of inter-firm cooperation driven by cognitive distance, appropriability conditions and external knowledge. Absorptive capacity of firms develops as an outcome of the interaction between absorptive R&D and cognitive distance from voluntary and involuntary knowledge spillovers. Thus, we offer a revision of the original model by Cohen and Levinthal (Econ J 99(397):569-596, 1989), accounting for recent empirical findings and explicitly modeling absorptive capacity within the framework of interactive learning. We apply that to the analysis of firms' cooperation and R&D investment preferences. The results show that cognitive distance and appropriability conditions between a firm and its cooperation partner have an ambiguous effect on the profit generated by the firm. Thus, a firm chooses to cooperate and selects a partner conditional on the investments in absorptive capacity it is willing to make to solve the understandability/novelty trade-off. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Furthermore, a firm's efforts to manage its sponsored community may also impact the firm's absorptive capacity, or its ability to effectively absorb and leverage the valuable knowledge created by the community. Thus, the purpose of this article is to investigate two research questions: 1) How does the boundary management of a firm-sponsored OSS community impact the community's innovation capacity? and 2) How does the boundary management of a firm-sponsored OSS community impact the firm's absorptive capacity?

First, although different configurations of absorptive capacity routines can lead to the successful implementation of the same management innovation – namely the reconfiguration of firms’ value chains through sourcing of business services from offshore countries – the sequence of developing routines, their adequacy, and the interdependencies fit between routines partly explain how rapidly and seamlessly a firm is able to implement a management innovation. Second, we identify managerial attention and organizational legitimacy as two critical and interrelated sources of variation of the efficiency in the process of adopting and adapting management innovations. Finally, attention direction by a top-level internal change agent is more effective than local problemistic search to foster managerial attention and organizational legitimacy to both the management innovation to be adopted, and the need to develop and put into practice an appropriate set of absorptive capacity routines. © The Author(s) 2014."
"Absorptive capacity and network orchestration in innovation communities - promoting service innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894349873&doi=10.1108%2fJBIM-08-2013-0167&partnerID=40&md5=258847003af62353dd2c5faeed94bd8b","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of service innovation in networks. Especially the most loosely coupled forms of innovation networks, innovation communities, can be valuable in service innovation, but may not be manageable in the traditional sense. Rather, they may require orchestration characterized by discreet guidance that also accommodates the specific nature of services. Through informed orchestration, it is possible to deal with several contingencies, and influence the absorptive capacity at the network level to generate new service innovations. Design/methodology/approach: These issues are examined through literature review and a case study. Findings: The findings suggest that individual orchestration mechanisms may be more closely connected to certain contingencies than others, and that both orchestration mechanisms and contingency factors have a role in absorptive capacity development within service innovation networks. Research limitations/implications: While the case study approach limits the possibility to make wide generalizations, the in-depth insights provide valuable knowledge. Practical implications: There has been a shift from inter-firm competition towards competition between networks of organizations, increasing relevance of absorptive capacity at the network level. Originality/value: Despite the recent increase in service innovation literature, research on service innovation taking place in networks is scant. Knowledge on some aspects can be derived from more traditional notions on technological innovation, but both the distinctive features of services and central characteristics of innovation networks make it necessary to reconsider some of the established views. In particular, managing - or rather orchestrating - service innovation is still a challenging area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Innovation cooperation is recognized as a driver of its potential side (PAC). Considering different forms of proximity, we expect to find a higher impact for interactions occurring between close partners. Human capital (HC) is expected to be as important as other organizational mechanisms for the innovation impact of PAC. An empirical application with Community Innovation Survey data confirms these arguments only partially. The firm's cooperation with geographically closer partners (i.e., in the same country) increases its PAC, but it is cooperation with institutionally distant ones (e.g., research organizations) that augments it. Among the integration mechanisms of external knowledge, those increasing the firm's HC are the only ones that positively moderate the innovation impact of PAC. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Using data from a survey on firms located in North Norway, we ask whether AC plays a mediating role between different external knowledge inflows and innovative performance. The results are consistent with AC as an important mediator for transforming external knowledge inflows into higher innovative performance if we include all SMEs in the sample. However, this result is not robust when considering the sub-sample of non-R&D SMEs only. External knowledge inflows have a much stronger direct effect on innovation performance for non-R&D firms and leave a weak mediating effect of AC.

Design/methodology/approach – The study is explorative, qualitative and elaborative in nature. Therefore, a multiple case study was selected and performed as the research strategy. The data were collected from four pharmaceutical SMEs licensed from European pharmaceutical large-scale enterprises. Findings – The results confirm that IIL has a strong effect on acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation as absorptive factors. Furthermore, the results have been enhanced by several contextual factors of ACAP human resources, inter-and intra-firm relationships, internal knowledge and managerial and strategic aspects. These contextual factors have also been influenced by IIL. Originality/value – From the licensee perspective in a developing context, examining the extant literature on non-equity strategic alliances shows that very few studies have empirically examined the impact of this kind of alliance, such as IIL, on SMEs’ ACAP. On this basis, the study provides evidence that non-equity strategic alliances, particularly IIL, enhance SMEs’ capabilities such as ACAP. In other words, to overcome SMEs’ resource limitations and inadequate capabilities, IIL provides opportunities for them to obtain capabilities and critical resources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We adopt the firm dynamics framework, which allows us to test the impact of foreign firms’ activity on the probability that local firms will exit. The empirical analysis relies on continuous survival models (Cox proportional hazard models) and uses a representative firm level database from the period of 2002–2010 with data concerning more than 4,000 Italian manufacturing firms. Our estimates regarding the whole sample show that horizontal and vertical linkages have no impact on firm survival. To further test this finding, we perform a more disaggregated analysis that allows for heterogeneity across firms and sectors. We obtain evidence that the effects of FDI spillovers on firm survival follow specific patterns at both the intra- and inter-industry levels based on differences in productivity between Italian firms and foreign firms and on the technological intensity of the industry. Foreign firms’ activity reduces the exit probability of competitors and of downstream local customers (through forward linkages) with low productivity gap but has no impact on high productivity gap firms. Firms in high technology intensive sectors do not benefit from horizontal FDI while in low and medium technology sectors they do. Differences in absorptive capacity may explain these results. However, we also find that vertical linkages with foreign firms in the upstream supplying industries spur firm duration in medium and high tech sectors. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

In fact, for customers in many B2B markets, the salesperson is the face of the firm. The sales function can be characterized as an inherently entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship is founded on knowing or seeing something others do not see, and the sales force has long been recognized as an important source of knowledge about a firm's customers and environment. However, there has been relatively little work linking entrepreneurship to international sales performance, especially in the B2B context.This paper focuses on the intelligence-gathering role of salespeople to firms practicing corporate entrepreneurship in the international B2B setting. More specifically, drawing on the theories of corporate entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors develop a conceptual model that proposes international sales performance for firms practicing corporate entrepreneurship will be enhanced when salespeople practice customer-oriented selling and the firm's absorptive capacity is stronger. Recommended methodology for testing the proposed model is a single-informant survey of sales managers with firms in the domain of interest, using structural equation modeling with moderator tests.

This transference requires absorptive capacity (AC), which allows an organization to identify external knowledge and convert it into value for the firm. Based on an approach of dynamic capabilities, AC encompasses three related learning processes: exploration, assimilation, and exploitation. Within the particular context of buyer-supplier relationships (BSR), the aim of this research is to examine AC, one of its most relevant antecedents - organizational compatibility - and its outcomes. Two samples of 153 and 199 companies, operating as key suppliers of two focal buyers, a European multinational retail chain and an American multinational spare parts distributor, respectively, constitute the empirical base of the study. Results derived from structural equation modeling and, more precisely, multi-group confirmatory factor analysis and a formal test of mediation, strongly indicate for both samples that AC mediates between organizational compatibility on the one hand and innovation and efficiency performance on the other hand. Results also indicate that the mediating effect of AC related to innovation increases with demand uncertainty. This paper thus suggests that managers must be aware that the selection of supply chain partners based on their compatibility alone is not enough. AC is necessary to achieve sustainable performance improvement. © 2014 Institute for Supply Management, Inc."

First, it attempts to identify the critical factors facilitating the acquisition of technology from foreign partner firms and performance enhancement in international collaborative formations. Second, it compares these factors across Western and Japanese sub-samples. A new concept, realised absorptive capacity, is employed to achieve these objectives. Using a sample collected through a questionnaire-based survey, our results show that trust and communication are critical components in transforming new knowledge, while active managerial involvement of the foreign firm and the participation of foreign expatriates are the keys to applying it for business operations. In particular, components consisting of the ability to exploit new knowledge (i.e. active managerial involvement of foreign firm, participation of foreign expatriates and provision of training) are closely associated with performance enhancement. In addition, our results confirm that there clearly exist different patterns of learning mechanisms and incompatible behaviours in improving performance between the two sub-samples.

While the moderating effect of AC on the relationship between supplier involvement and PI performance is investigated, a firm's agility in PI is entered as one dimension of the firm's performance to accommodate a multidimensional perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper formulates six hypotheses extracted from the relevant literature. The survey was conducted over the internet by using web-based questionnaire. A sampling frame of 1,200 manufacturing UK-based companies provided 233 usable responses. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a validity and reliability of constructs and further the paper employed hierarchical multiple regression to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results while reaffirm some of the existing theories of the subject provide some differing view of the issues allowing projection of new insight on the approach to PI and involvement of suppliers. The results support the proposition of PI performance multidimensionality where achievements beyond financial and market-related factors play a critical role. Furthermore, research findings suggest AC as a competitive factor that can provide the grounds for proactively winning in the PI game through increasing agility capabilities.

Information processing and resource-based view theories propose a positive relationship between environmental turbulence and knowledge search breadth, whereas transaction cost economics and managerial attention theoretical perspectives posit that knowledge search breadth will be negatively influenced by environmental turbulence. In the context of Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this study examines the direct effect of environmental turbulence and the interactive effect of environmental turbulence and absorptive capacity (ACAP) on external knowledge search breadth. Design/methodology/approach – This study adopted firm-level data collected via questionnaires from SMEs within the manufacturing sector in China. The partial least squares method was used to explore the determinants of the external knowledge search breadth of Chinese SMEs. Findings – The results reveal that external search breadth tends to increase with an increase in a firm’s perceived environmental turbulence. In addition, the interaction between ACAP and environmental turbulence will be negatively related to external knowledge search breadth. The empirical evidence indicates information processing and resource-based view theories are more powerful in explaining the external knowledge search behavior of Chinese SMEs. Originality/value – Unlike most of the innovation search literature, which have focused on the effect on performance of external search, this study focuses on the antecedents of firms’ innovation search behavior. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between environmental turbulence and knowledge search breadth as well as the understanding of the influence of ACAP on external knowledge search in the context of SMEs from emerging economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Besides, the empirical results show that absorptive capacity plays a partial mediator in the manufacturing industry but a full mediator in the service industry. If companies would like to raise their new product development performance or service innovation performance, they have to enhance their resource commitment, resource flexibility, and absorptive capacity.

Doing so highlights the strategic, relational nature of place branding. The authors focus specifically on first- and zero-order capabilities, integrating absorptive capacity (first-order) and an innovation capability (zero-order) into a place branding framework. We define an innovation capability within a place branding context and offer absorptive capacity as a mechanism through which DMO leaders can exploit external knowledge acquisition.Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a theoretical framework of the place branding process that integrates firm capabilities. A framework based on analyzing existing place branding models and integrating organizational capabilities, which find root in strategic management literature, was developed.Findings – Findings indicate that existing frameworks address operational and customer capabilities in some manner yet largely ignore innovation capabilities. A definition of an innovation capability for place brand managers and scholars is offered, and offer absorptive capacity as means to integrate external knowledge into the DMO. Utilizing multiple levels of capabilities allows a firm to influence customer-based brand equity. Testable propositions based on the authors’ framework are offered.Practical implications – Managerial implications of integrating stakeholder capabilities into place branding include appreciating a culture of innovation within DMOs, learning from external stakeholders meaningfully and regularly and encouraging creative thinking that can produce new processes, policies or services.Originality/value – By integrating organizational capabilities, attention is drawn to internal aspects of the place branding process the place can control directly. Capabilities dictate how an organization sees itself; learns from its stakeholders; and then integrates that knowledge into organizational, stakeholder and innovation capabilities. Therefore, capabilities are inherently internal mechanisms through which a DMO can influence place brand outcomes, which are understood here as brand equity elements. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, the literature on managing knowledge (or better knowledge work) acknowledges also an epistemology of practice (knowledge is unpredictable and dynamic and constituted in and through practice). Moreover, the literature on AC is relatively silent on the relationship between knowledge and power. In this paper, the authors argue that the AC construct should be interpreted in light of the possession and the practice perspectives of knowledge and power.

In many countries, financial support for technology intermediaries has become one of the key measures of indirect public support. However, little research has assessed the impact of indirect policy measures. In this paper, we shed light on the conditions under which technology intermediaries contribute to knowledge and networking outcomes generated by the firms that call upon them. We hereby focus on firm network and competence additionality as measures for cognitive capacity additionality and study the impact of technology intermediaries on firms. In doing so, we distinguish between R&D and R&D related activity technology intermediaries engage in. The results indicate that absorptive capacity of the technology intermediary does not affect cognitive capacity additionality generated by firms in R&D activities, while the results for R&D related activities are mixed and depending on the type of cognitive capacity additionality studied. The absorptive capacity of firms does not directly affect cognitive capacity additionality, but the results of mediation analysis show that firms with higher levels of absorptive capacity use the services of the technology intermediary more intensively, and subsequently generate higher levels of cognitive capacity additionality. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which banks combine external knowledge with internal knowledge to build customer value. Design/methodology/approach: A firm's knowledge corridor is an organizational capacity, referring to the ability to absorb external knowledge and utilize it in generating innovative outputs. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of knowledge transfer and knowledge storage/retrieval processes as bridges between ""potential absorptive capacity"" and ""realized absorptive capacity"" and its effects on the application of knowledge through an empirical investigation of 76 banks. Findings: The results are calculated using structural equation modelling. This leads to the main conclusion that a ""realized absorptive capacity"" is unlikely without being fostered by the transference and storage of new knowledge and it therefore requires empowerment by its facilitating factors. Practical implications: The key managerial implication of this paper is that the survival and success of banks requires that administrators and the organizations they manage meet the challenge of combining external knowledge with internal knowledge. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical support for the argument that the impacts of external knowledge move up from the individuals to groups and then the entire organization.

"Individual antecedents of ACAP and implications of social context in joint engineering project teams: A conceptual model","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898459327&doi=10.1108%2fJKM-08-2013-0332&partnerID=40&md5=c477c297a4815dbd5745ac29ca7f0962","Purpose: This paper attempts to propose a conceptual model to explain the micro-level antecedents of absorptive capacity (ACAP) and social context of joint engineering project teams. It delineates ACAP into four dimensions and suggests specific level for each dimension. Revisiting the micro-foundational origin of ACAP, acquisition of partner's embedded knowledge through joint project teams requires complex interaction among individuals, thus the effect of individual differences and perception in the team's context is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Cohen and Levinthal's assertion on the conceptual affinity that ACAP shares with creative capacity and organizational learning was revisited. Upon synthesizing pertinent literature, individual antecedents were conceptualized, while strategic alliance literature was examined to theorize on the social context. Findings: Propositions relating individual antecedents and social context to associated dimension of ACAP are postulated. Furthermore, the paper suggests a need for further inquest on the implication of cultural differences. Research limitations/implications: The hypothesized relationships among the constructs are subject to empirical investigation in order to deepen our understanding on individual differences and social contextual effects. Practical implications: Based on the conceptualized relationships among micro-level antecedents, multidimensional ACAP, and social context, this manuscript recommends some practical guidelines in the context of joint engineering project teams. Originality/value: This study explicates the micro-level antecedents of ACAP within a joint engineering project team. By integrating individual and social context, it advances multilevel conceptualization of ACAP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

To study this adoption process and get insights into the underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate HIT adoption. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Design/methodology/approach: A balanced panel of 1,266 firms that respond to the Survey of Business Strategies for a five-year period was used, which represents a total of 6,330 observations. Findings: The influence of the absorptive capacity on new products is significant, with an inverted U-shaped relationship. The interaction between external sources of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity has a negative effect on innovation up to a certain level (substitution effect), after which that interaction improves the innovation of firms, displaying a complementary effect. Practical implications: Firms with excess of internal sources of knowledge do not obtain better innovative results because overtime firms tend to inertia and need external sources of knowledge to obtain new knowledge. Firms must be conscious that the effect on innovation of using a strategy of external knowledge acquisition could be different depending on their internal knowledge base level. Thus, those firms that select their strategies to combine knowledge appropriately will have better results. Originality/value: This paper reveals that the positive effect of internal sources of knowledge on innovation decline after it reaches a high level because those firms with strong absorptive capacity may enter a state of organizational inertia that reduces their innovation. This research enhances the importance of identifying each of the external knowledge sources likely to be used, since their influence on innovation differs depending on the level of internal knowledge.

We also examine potential moderating effects of absorptive capacity and supply network partner innovativeness on innovation output. We hypothesize that firms will experience greater innovation output from (1) higher levels of supply network accessibility and supply network interconnectedness, (2) the interaction between the levels of these two structural characteristics, (3) the moderating role of absorptive capacity on supply network accessibility and the moderating role of supply network partner innovativeness on supply network interconnectedness. Supply network partner relationships are drawn in the context of the electronics industry using data from multiple sources. We use social network analysis to create measures for each supply network structural characteristic. Using regression techniques to test the relationship between these structural characteristics and firm innovation for a sample of 390 firms, our findings suggest that supply network accessibility has a significant association with a firm's innovation output. The results also indicate that interconnected supply networks strengthen the association between supply network accessibility and innovation output. Moreover, the influence of the two structural characteristics on innovation output can be enhanced by a firm's absorptive capacity and level of supply network partner innovativeness. By addressing the need for deeper structural analysis, this study contributes to supply chain research by accounting for the embedded nature of ties in supply networks, and showing how these structural characteristics influence the knowledge and information flows residing within a firm's supply network. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Each affects the value created from the firms' technological capabilities differently due to absorptive capacity, knowledge redundancy, and organizational disruption. Further, the low quantity of innovations observed in acquisitions with low target overlap may conceal an offsetting increase in their novelty. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual study integrates literature on franchising, knowledge based view of the firm, absorptive capacity, and service dominant logic to propose a theoretical framework for value co-creation in franchising using knowledge as an operant resource. Findings: The proposed framework suggests that in a franchise network value is co-created by three key actors - franchisor, franchisees, and the customers; the operant resource these key actors bring to the value creation process is knowledge; and the absorptive capacity of principal actors and the appropriation hazard affect the flow and sharing of knowledge. Research limitations/implications: The authors hope that the proposed knowledge exchange framework for value co-creation in franchise networks provides an impetus for future research in this critical aspect of franchising - i.e. viewing knowledge as an operant resource and viewing the three actors as resource integrators and co-creators of value. Practical implications: The proposed framework suggests that managers in franchise industry should stop looking at consumers and franchisees as passive operand resources, but look at them as operant resource. They should also alter their perspective about the source of competitive advantage, with the focus shifting to knowledge as the operant resource.

The study focus such relationship within the use of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems in those companies. Results show that low levels of absorptive capacity of the companies are related not only to technological aspects of guidance or investment in R & D companies in this sector but they are also closely related to motivation to change of its members as well as the involvement of managers in adapting to servitization. This fact allows the firms to identify the needs of their current and potential customers through the provision of services to add value to the media product. Design/methodology: This article is based on a sample of 54 publishers of regional and local press. We used path analysis, which allows us to determine the degree of influence of each of the dimensions of the constructs studied (motivation to change, absorptive capacity, and performance of the company in the dual capacity as workers and processes). Findings: The results support the hypothesis that absorption capacity is essential to evaluate, assimilate and apply especially, for commercial purposes, external expertise to guide these companies towards new business models that add new value to the customer. In order to integrate the customer inside the value chain a shift from an operations model to a production model of service operations is crucial. Currently, newspaper companies are going through difficult times. Readers and advertisers which are the two main sources of income seem to be turning to other means of communication which adversely affects its financial performance. To meet these challenges, newspapers must change the way they organize their activities. However this requires a catalyst such as motivation to change, such as in the case of web newspapers trying to maximize servitization based on knowledge of customer needs. This evolution of the traditional model weakness occurs due to low levels of absorption capacity of these companies explained by other variables such as low motivation towards change of the members of the organization. Research limitations/implications: Our work presents the characteristics of an exploratory study with limitations as we deal exclusively with media release written for regional and local character, which makes the results difficult to extend to other sectors and even within the publishing industry nationwide. Some aspects of this work have not been sufficiently developed, such as those related to the importance of multidisciplinary training, the organization of work in these companies and their leadership, and the origin of the dual nature of these companies. Practical implications: The results of our study show that media companies should emphasize, especially in the case of publishers of written newspapers, customer relationships for readers and advertisers. This is where the implementation of IT systems to inform about customer preferences allows media companies to get closer to their customers ( readers and advertisers) differently as they used to do. In the case of online media, publishing companies seemed not to have a clear objective and preferences to allow them to add services to the traditional product in order to foster satisfaction for readers and advertisers and improve knowledge. In this paper we show a model for motivation to involve managers to find variants or alternatives to the current business model in order to meet the needs of their customers. Originality/value: We are facing a shortage of scientific literature that relates, directly, absorptive capacity, CRM and servitizacion applied to media companies in print and much less so obviously highlight the importance of motivation change as a variable to explain the varying ability of companies belonging to this sector. This Research also proves that this sector has a special need to develop motivation to initiate servitization strategies for future survival."

The results of simultaneous-equations analysis reveal that there exist reciprocal relationships between the two; however, in opposing directions. While increasing innovation attracts more foreign direct investment, more inward FDI reduces innovation. Indigenous innovation is increased mainly through improvements in absorptive capacity, particularly in research and development (R&D). Government effectiveness, as the mediating factor, lessens the adverse impact of FDI on innovation while amplifying the positive effect of R&D spending on innovation. Because innovation and FDI are crucial policies that enhance economic growth, this study suggests improving overall government effectiveness as well as increasing R&D activities in order to channel FDI spillovers to trigger more indigenous innovations, which may eventually induce more foreign direct investment. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

In recent years, enhanced rates of information flow have increased the ability for a greater overall number and diversity of foreign players to enter emerging technology development trajectories. At the same time, these trends are creating more dispersed networks with concomitant problems associated with information flow in such diffuse situations. Rates of diffusion of emerging technologies are also importantly affected by the number of scientific fields and generic technologies combined to create the new technology and the level of resultant complexity; higher levels of complexity can slow down diffusion rates. Further, at the country level, absorptive capacity is largely determined through institutions and their policies; however, in terms of enabling diffusion of technology to move effectively downstream from science to market, this requires social capabilities. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Non-innovators need market power and the presence of an R&D department to profit from public knowledge. Innovators need less sheltered environments and lesser R&D effort, though the availability of resources and absorptive capacity is necessary. Using a sample of 1,031 Spanish manufacturing firms, we conclude that practical experience in technological innovation enhances firms' perceptions on the usefulness of public research, not directly but by enabling certain internal changes, i.e. it produces encounters between corporate choices and public research. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

While firms rely on external relations to compensate for a lack of internal assets, we find that a company's propensity to cooperate in innovation is associated with its own IC profile. In particular, firms with common knowledge assets are more likely to benefit from business relational capital.

"Anticipation of new technologies: Supply chain antecedents and competitive performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904579431&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-09-2012-0386&partnerID=40&md5=6f0e181d1cc717560337f98da05b2210","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose and empirically validates a measure of the anticipation of new technologies (ANT) construct, first suggested by Hayes and Wheelwright (1984). ANT allows establishment of a sustained competitive advantage through acquiring new technologies and the capability to use them, in advance of actual need. The theoretical foundation for ANT is developed using the literature on absorptive capacity. Several elements of supply chain management are proposed as antecedents to ANT. Design/methodology/approach: Perceptual survey data from 317 manufacturing plants in ten countries was used to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings: The key supply chain antecedents of ANT are supply chain planning, internal integration and supplier integration. ANT was related to both operational and cost performance. Research limitations/implications: Potential limitations include the use of an existing database, the plant as the unit of analysis and the need to include customer integration, as well as supplier integration. The results demonstrate the competitive importance of the ANT construct and the key role that relationships with suppliers play in its development. Practical implications: This research sheds new light on a construct whose roots are inherently practical. Suppliers and their extended networks are an important source of external knowledge about technology and future customer needs, thus, supply chain relationships are an important contributor to ANT. Originality/value: Although the role of technology in establishing a competitive advantage has been thoroughly studied, the effectiveness of developing technologies that are expected to be important in the future has not, although this concept was first introduced almost 30 years ago. The authors use absorptive capacity to develop the role of supply chain relationships in building an organization's ANT capability, contributing to the operations strategy literature by grounding a practical construct in the theoretical literature and demonstrating its importance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In the decade since their laudable article was published, some contributions have been made highlighting the contingencies related to the effectiveness of HRM practices in MNCs, especially those affecting an organizations' absorptive capacity. These contingencies - the ""moving parts"" - include country-level differences in HR systems, cross-cultural differences in acceptance of HR practices and individual-level factors affecting the effectiveness of HRM practices. With an eye toward the future, I discuss these contingencies, paying closest attention to the effect of the individual differences affecting employees' willingness to engage in knowledge sharing. From the perspective of HRM, this year's Decade Award article opened some significant doors for future research; my goal for this commentary is to highlight them and the many that remain relatively unexplored."

Specifically, we contrast the expectations of senior managers of social media tool adoption with the benefits perceived by organizational members after the implementation of these tools. We analyzed empirical findings from 252 respondents to a survey of three global companies before and after social media tool adoption. The respondents to the survey held various internal functions and were from several organizational layers. According to our results, the working practices, notably in terms of information sharing, among organizations become more similar due to the social media tool adoption. We present individual-level drivers of the use of social media tools based on expectations and perceived benefits, such as increased transparency inside the organization. Additionally, based on the empirical evidence, we present both managerial and theoretical implications. The identified drivers can be used by practitioners as guidance in social media tool implementation. From a theoretical perspective, the study contributes to discussions on absorptive capacity, new product development (NPD) performance, and company-level social media tool adoption. © 2014 PICMET."

Using three supply factors specific to a country - supply environment, supply infrastructure, absorptive capacity, we construct a rating system representing the potential of a nation to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). We use the combinatorics- and Boolean-based logical analysis of data (LAD) method to capture the individual and combined impact of the supply factors on the FDI inflow. The LAD classification system is shown to be robust, cross-validating very well, thereby allowing its use for prediction purposes, and permitting the derivation of a rating system that can have various granularity levels. By linking FDI potential with supply capability related factors, the findings of this research contribute to future FDI decisions by firms as well as provide assistance and direction to strategic planners of countries that seek to enhance their attractiveness as FDI destinations. As technology matures, production processes start to lack differentiation and firms look to establish facilities globally to become more competitive. This study enhances decision-making process pinpointing areas for focused consideration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
"Knowledge Acquisition and Assimilation in Tourism-Innovation Processes","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899914379&doi=10.1080%2f15022250.2014.887609&partnerID=40&md5=3928c788b9f810e903777b1718c30838","The paper develops a framework and an understanding of the external knowledge absorption in nature-based tourism companies. The concept of potential absorptive capacity is the starting point for exploring how external knowledge (tacit and explicit) is absorbed and assimilated in tourism-innovation processes. Although knowledge is the engine that drives innovation, tourism firms can have problems and challenges when trying to absorb external knowledge for innovation. The main challenge is to access and absorb tacit knowledge. This type of knowledge is personal and sticky and therefore difficult to acquire and assimilate into the existing knowledge pool of organizations. Tacit knowledge is also difficult to imitate and is therefore important for developing original and competitive innovations. In this study, knowledge acquisition and assimilation processes and how knowledge challenges are handled are investigated by adopting a multiple, qualitative case-study strategy that focuses on three Icelandic whale-watching firms. This study contributes to the tourism-innovation discussion by identifying tourism-specific abilities for the acquisition and assimilation of knowledge. The sense-making and strategic interpretation of this knowledge are considered to be important subsequent steps in the innovation process. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis."
"When does inward technology licensing facilitate firms' NPD performance? A contingency perspective","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84888641875&doi=10.1016%2fj.technovation.2013.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=a022cfb43f79f77fbf2d620534060dcc","Many firms find inward technology licensing (ITL), as a means to access external technological knowledge, an effective and relatively inexpensive way for new product development (NPD). However, although the literature has suggested some advantages and disadvantages of ITL with respect to NPD, the relationship between ITL and licensee firms' subsequent NPD performance has not yet been found convincingly evident. Sharing with many other likeminded scholars and practitioners, we believe that the dynamics between external knowledge, internal capability, external environment, and firm performance should be investigated through a contingency perspective. Thus, this study posits that a firm's propensity to develop new products through ITL is contingent upon two categories of contingency factors that are internal and external to firms. Using a dataset containing information about Chinese firms' licensing activities, we find support for our hypotheses: the positive relationship between ITL and NPD performance of a licensee firm is moderated by firms' absolute and relative absorptive capacity and the knowledge endowment in the region where the licensee firm operates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Focusing on firms that are confronted with emerging technological fields, the authors examine the consequences of their alliance portfolio’s technological diversity on superior product innovation. The literature has not been conclusive about the consequences of portfolio diversity. The authors examine the nature of the effect of portfolio diversity on superior product innovation and follow up on the call for a contingency perspective—as not all firms benefit equally from portfolio diversity. The contingency perspective is based on the assertion that a firm’s past strategies in internal knowledge creation are a source of experiences that increase the firm’s capability to leverage extramural knowledge. Theoretically, the study thus contributes to the absorptive capacity literature that has recently acknowledged the importance of such higher-order internal capabilities. By identifying concrete dimensions of internal knowledge creation that enable firms to benefit from portfolio diversity, actionable recommendations are derived on how to align internal knowledge creation with external knowledge sourcing. The empirical support in the biopharmaceutical industry corroborates the developed theory and serves as a warning signal for firms that are ill prepared to leverage a diverse alliance portfolio. © The Author(s) 2012."

The KAM teams in this study are formed of members originating from several supplier companies that integrate and apply resources with their customers in a business network. In the co-creation of integrated solutions within such business networks, KAM teams - drawing on organizational learning theory and knowledge management - are considered as knowledge integrators. The purpose of this study is to analyze the KAM teams' absorptive capacity - that is, how knowledge is acquired, assimilated, and applied in the co-creation of integrated solutions. The study employs a qualitative case study approach, based on 30 in-depth interviews in nine supplier companies operating in advertising, marketing and consulting, and in three key customer companies.

It examines both the ""outside-in"" and ""coupled"" modes of open innovation. From an analysis of prior research on how firms leverage external sources of innovation, it suggests a four-phase model in which a linear process - (1) obtaining, (2) integrating, and (3) commercializing external innovations - is combined with (4) interaction between the firm and its collaborators. This model is used to classify papers taken from the top 25 innovation journals, complemented by highly cited work beyond those journals. A review of 291 open innovation-related publications from these sources shows that the majority of these articles indeed address elements of this inbound open innovation process model. Specifically, it finds that researchers have front-loaded their examination of the leveraging process, with an emphasis on obtaining innovations from external sources. However, there is a relative dearth of research related to integrating and commercializing these innovations. Research on obtaining innovations includes searching, enabling, filtering, and acquiring - each category with its own specific set of mechanisms and conditions. Integrating innovations has been mostly studied from an absorptive capacity perspective, with less attention given to the impact of competencies and culture (including ""not invented here""). Commercializing innovations puts the most emphasis on how external innovations create value rather than how firms capture value from those innovations. Finally, the interaction phase considers both feedback for the linear process and reciprocal innovation processes such as cocreation, network collaboration, and community innovation. This review and synthesis suggests several gaps in prior research. One is a tendency to ignore the importance of business models, despite their central role in distinguishing open innovation from earlier research on interorganizational collaboration in innovation. Another gap is a tendency in open innovation to use ""innovation"" in a way inconsistent with earlier definitions in innovation management. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research that include examining the end-to-end innovation commercialization process, and studying the moderators and limits of leveraging external sources of innovation. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association."

It focuses on the factors that determine the appropriation of innovation activities like the value of sales of the firms, networking, science-industry linkage, competitive pressure and demand pull. To this end, we suggest an econometric analysis of 586 Tunisian firms using simple and bivariate logit regressions. We find significant interaction effects between appropriability and R&D activity. The results confirm that patenting is primarily driven by firm-level factors, not by industry affiliation. Access to external knowledge and firm's specific characteristics are the most linked factors to the innovation protection. Firms that use appropriation instruments have a higher probability of investing in R&D than others. Indeed, the capacity to integrate external knowledge and performing R&D (networking, science-industry linkage, cooperation with other firms, belonging to a group) is related to the use of appropriation instruments. We find that appropriation instruments have a significant effect on product innovation. The effect on process innovation is not significant for Tunisian firms. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Most of these studies are concerned with large foreign-invested and state-owned firms. They have found integration into global production networks (GPN) as well as strong governmental support to be important success factors. In contrast, little has been published about the innovation and upgrading behaviour of private small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper addresses the upgrading of private SMEs based on a sample from the electronics industry of the Pearl River Delta (PRD). We find that a number of success factors usually assumed to stimulate upgrading in China have no influence. These include GPN integration, government contacts and other inter-personal linkages. The upgrading of private SMEs can instead be best explained through a focus on the growing domestic market, overcoming typical resource constraints and a reliance on internal capabilities.

The lack of such studies dealing with KMS adoption within cluster of firms and focusing on knowledge absorption motivated the study focus on how the IT-enabled knowledge capabilities affect firm innovation. To overcome this void in the literature this study presents the preliminary results of a multiple case study conducted on six SMEs within a cluster of firms adopting a digital platform, a KMS, aiming at generating innovation and internationalization opportunities. We carried out a systematic literature review over 200 articles by identifying three main research areas: knowledge management, joint activities and business value of IT. We built an a priori theoretical framework that extends the limitations of previous studies by focusing on the adoption within a cluster of firms. For scrutinizing the theoretical framework on knowledge sharing, a multiple case study approach was chosen and carried out on the six firms. The preliminary results contribute in explaining the role of digital platforms and the strength of interpersonal connections in influencing the performances improvement of the whole cluster. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."

Design/methodology/approach – A grounded theory methodology was adopted. Research was conducted through a total of 37 interviews with key informants in the UK FMCG industry, packaging industry and associated firms. Findings – Three distinct levels of packaging development were revealed: skin deep, body modification and format change. The emphasis within many firms is primarily on changes to packaging at the level of the label (skin deep) or aesthetic design (body modification), whilst technological and format changes are overlooked. The factors that contribute to the level at which development is undertaken are identified. Research limitations/implications – Existing literature has largely examined packaging at the level of skin-deep and body modification. The development of new packaging technology has been overlooked. This study’s propositions guide the way forward for further research. Practical implications – For firms, the development of new formats and genuine packaging innovation may be being overlooked. There is a need for them to re-examine their activities to ensure that they are addressing all three levels.

This paper seeks to deepen our understanding by exploring the time- dependent cumulative effects of the spillover and technology opportunity variables examined by Jaffe (1983). This paper will build on the pertinent literature to suggest hypotheses to better explain the relationship between R&D investment and knowledge production as proxied by patent production. The hypothesis will be tested against a dataset built by examining twenty-five of the largest global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on data extracted from the NBER patent citation database and COMPUSTAT. A model will be developed to predict the rate at which R&D investment translates into economically useful knowledge as proxied by patent grants. Finally, the paper calls for future research to identify the managerial action that comprises the cumulative antecedents of R&D success."

Business units play different roles within their respective corporate knowledge networks as knowledge providers, knowledge receivers, both or neither.Design/methodology/approach – Survey data from a sample of 225 business divisions were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).Originality/value – This study contributes to existent research on knowledge transfer and performance outcomes by demonstrating the usefulness of the knowledge role as an integrating concept within this literature. It also extends the four-role framework to the prescriptive domain and tests its normative implications in an intensive internal knowledge transfer setting which has to date gone relatively unnoticed, as is that of multi-business firms.Findings – Results indicate that divisions which occupy knowledge roles that reveal the possession of unique knowledge (knowledge signaling) or guarantee the accumulation of new knowledge (knowledge learning) outperform those divisions that have access to spilled knowledge (knowledge depreciation) or have no access to any kind of knowledge (knowledge insulation).Practical implications – Four knowledge roles are distinguished according to the extent to which a business division provides the rest of the corporation with knowledge or receives knowledge from the rest of the corporation, thus exploring the issue of internal knowledge transfer from an integrated perspective that takes the directionality of knowledge flows and the position within the knowledge network into account. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Differences hint at already bridged or non-bridged technological distances. Further information, given during expert interviews, present reasons for different knowledge transfer and recombination mechanisms in different dyadic collaborations. We generally find evidence that technological distance can be bridged by reducing geographical or social distances. When research activities are really complementary and collaboration partners have a common (technical) language, there is less need of decreasing other distances. Integrating research along the traditional battery value chain needs more social or geographical proximity to decrease and not just bridge technological distance at least in a practical way. © 2041 Imperial College Press."

However, the degree to which these initiatives are implemented and can be enhanced based on their interdependencies is an open question. How organizations and the change initiatives they pursue might benefit from more careful examination of potential interdependencies among projects was explored in this article. Purpose: The aim of this study was to introduce a multiproject management conceptualization that stresses project interdependencies and suggests synergies can be found to enhance overall project and organizational performance. It examines this conceptualization in the context of a health system pursuing several major initiatives to capture insights into the nature of such interdependencies. Methodology/Approach: Longitudinal qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with hospital leaders attempting to manage multiple initiatives being implemented by the system's leadership team was used in this study. Findings: The implementation of an electronic medical record (EMR) is empirically identified as the most central among multiple projects based on other projects dependencies on the EMR. Furthermore, concerns for data are identified most frequently as success factors across all projects. This reinforces the depiction of the EMR as a central organizational focus. Practical Implications: A unique perspective on multiproject management in hospitals and on EMR projects is presented. In addition, the interdependency conceptualization and its application and results provide insights into multiproject management that can help ensure that benefits of individual projects are more fully optimized or exploited in leveraging the effectiveness of other project initiatives.

Methodology/approach - I look at the secondary evidence on FDI and development and explore some of the causes for this ambiguity. Findings - The complexities of global value chains and networks have begun to trivialise the simplistic principle that increased multinational enterprise (MNE) activity automatically implies a proportional increase in spillovers and linkages. Value/originality - Policies towards MNEs need to be closely linked and integrated with industrial policy. MNE activity needs to be evaluated by considering the kinds of externalities that are generated; whether and how domestic actors can internalise them, and building up absorptive capacities to achieve this.

Disseminative capability and knowledge transfer in the automotive industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890510233&doi=10.1111%2fjpim.12081&partnerID=40&md5=92f6e04414cde2100273f9b41fdf8b1b","Innovations in the automotive industry are increasingly building on contributions from different technological fields. Correspondingly, firms in this industry more than ever tend to form research and development (R&D) alliances that aim at innovating new products through integrating separate fields and transferring knowledge. While, in symmetrical R&D alliances, each partner intends to ultimately maintain their distinctive and specialized knowledge base, overlapping knowledge facilitates cooperation and ultimately alliance success. Thus, the capability for knowledge transfer between partners is crucial in such R&D alliances. The literature provides ample evidence that such knowledge transfer is more likely to succeed if the recipient firm has absorptive capability. However, whereas the characteristics of the knowledge transfer process and the recipient firm are well understood, limited attention has so far been given to the issue of the knowledge source firm's ability to transfer knowledge to R&D alliance partners. This study focuses on the impact of source firm capability on successful knowledge transfer in R&D alliances. The study develops a theoretical framework of disseminative capability consisting of five dimensions and tests it on a sample of 59 projects in R&D alliances in the automotive industry. To ensure content validity and avoid common source bias, data were collected from both alliance partners. To test the hypotheses, multiple regression analyses were performed. The results reveal that the source firm's disseminative capability including the attainment of expert knowledge, assessing the recipient firm's knowledge base, and encoding knowledge are positively related to knowledge transfer success, while, surprisingly, detaching knowledge and support of knowledge application in the recipient firm are negatively related. Intentionally or unintentionally, disseminating knowledge across firm boundaries is widely perceived as detrimental to a firm's competitive advantage. Accordingly, the literature tends to downplay disseminative capability as an important means of exploiting external knowledge in collaborative settings. By demonstrating potential benefits for the source firm to transfer knowledge to the allying R&D partner firm, this paper reinvigorates the collaborative dimension in knowledge transfer. Further, the paper is the first of this kind to theoretically explain and empirically show that dimensions of disseminative capability of collaborators in R&D alliances are important for knowledge transfer, whereas disseminative capability is the complementary inverse of an organization's absorptive capacity. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association."

The aim of this study was investigate whether the presence of FDI produces productivity spillovers in Brazilian processing industries. We conduct our analysis using a panel database on twenty-three Brazilian processing industries and applied Moderated Multiple Regression (MMR) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) analysis of variance to address potential spillover effects from foreign presence. This paper finds evidences of the coexistence of both positive and negative effects arising from FDI on the productivity of Brazilian industries. We found negative effects for FDI presence in labor-intensive industries. Furthermore, FDI benefits depend on the absorptive capacity of industries, confirming the hypothesis that a minimum level of absorptive capacity is required so that locally owned enterprises (LOEs) can benefit from foreign presence."

We argue that such disparity may stem from inattention to investment motivations of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in foreign markets and to the fact that learning patterns of subsidiaries can be influenced by foreign firms' market-seeking or efficiency-seeking behaviors. We find that absorptive capacity in learning organizations and daily interactions with knowledge possessors are essential to learning from parent firms. In addition, active support from parent firms is particularly crucial for subsidiaries seeking to improve operational efficiency of MNEs. We also suggest that potential absorptive capacity plays a catalyst role in initiating knowledge acquisition, particularly in cases where MNEs have market-seeking motivations. Copyright © 2014 ASAC.

Hypotheses were developed and tested by using multiple regression, structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling and included an empirical test of moderator effects.Findings: The findings suggest that individual and group autonomy, along with individual experiences of absorptive capacity, supports complementarily inter-organizational knowledge transfer.Research limitations/implications: The study reinforces the idea that individual and group autonomy are enabling conditions for knowledge transfer from project settings to parent organizations. Absorptive capacity, in line with more recent theorizing, is conceived of and measured as an organizational meta-routine, and we recommend replication of this study in various multi-level settings using longitudinal designs.Practical implications: The study encourages managers to focus on distributing powers to individual facilitation and boundary-spanning roles and on creating cross-functional venues that promote the sharing of knowledge across different organizational units. The study also recommends that practitioners pay attention to the prominent role of autonomy at both the individual and group levels to support the dissemination of knowledge across boundaries.Originality/value: The study provides empirical evidence regarding the simultaneous role of individual autonomy, group autonomy and absorptive capacity that together provide the explanatory power required for knowledge transfer in inter-organizational settings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Analyses of survey data of private Chinese firms that have made outward foreign direct investments (OFDI) show that only 50 percent follow the Uppsala model in which firms follow a staged approach. The other 50 percent follow more risky explorative OFDI approaches in which the firms learn on the ground experimentally from their OFDI. We further investigate how the founders' congenital learning, firms' inward international experience, potential absorptive capabilities, and motivations to learn, influence OFDI performance and how learning outcomes mediate these relationships. We show that the relationship between the firm's potential absorptive capacity and its OFDI performance is fully mediated by what the firm learned from the OFDI project. Also the firm's motivation to learn directly affects performance and is partially mediated by what the firm has learned."

The research model examines the influence of technological context (perceived benefits and perceived costs), organizational context (firm size, top management support, and absorptive capacity), and environmental context (trading partners and competitive advantage) on e-SCM adoption. Data gathered from 283 IS managers (127 for non-adopters and 156 for adopters) in large Taiwanese firms were employed to test the relationships between the research model constructs using the logistic regression analysis. The results reveal that firms with certain perceived benefits, perceived costs, top management support, absorptive capacity, and competitive pressure are more likely to adopt e-SCM. While technological context is a major determinant of the decision to adopt, it has no direct effect on the extent of e-SCM adoption. The extent of e-SCM adoption is mainly determined by organizational and environmental contexts. Implications for practice and research are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Based on a sample of 312 innovative technology products introduced between 1987 and 2006 in the U.S. and a long-horizon event study with control firms, we study the impact of innovative technology products on the long-term financial performance of a firm. In particular, we examine how the knowledge characteristics of the firm, which embrace its knowledge absorptive capacity, knowledge impact, and knowledge diversity, moderate such an impact. We find that on average an innovative technology product increases the firm's return on assets (ROA) (relative to control firms) by 2.18% in the second year after product introduction. However, the value of an innovative technology product varies with the knowledge characteristics of the firm that invented it. We find that the financial impact of technology products is stronger when firms have higher knowledge absorptive capacity, and more impactful and less diversified knowledge (as measured by patents). We classify firms into three categories based on their knowledge characteristics. We find that firms with a high knowledge fit increase their ROA by 4.55% after product introduction, while those with a low knowledge fit receive no benefit from the innovative technology products at all. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly clear for manufacturing and this importance of foreign sales has increased over time, simultaneous to an opening up of the Swedish economy. Even though service industries have seen an increase in both R&D and trade over time, it is thus mainly manufacturing that has benefited from increased possibilities for absorptive capacity. This result suggests a clear dichotomy between manufacturing and services in terms of how they react to trade and how they turn towards the foreign market vs. the domestic market to find stimuli for innovation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

We distinguish alliances mobilizing similar resources by partners (called 'endogamies' as allies build on their similarities) from alliances pooling different resources (called 'exogamies' as allies build on their differences). We propose that: (a) the impact of RAC on knowledge transfers is reinforced in exogamies, but reduced in endogamies; (b) the knowledge ambiguity and cultural distance effect is less in endogamies than in exogamies; (c) the trust and knowledge protection impact is stronger in exogamies than in endogamies; (d) the learning intent impact on knowledge transfers is similar in endogamies and exogamies. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd."

We also show that local search is curvilinearly (inverted U-shape) associated with the degree of valuableness of subsequent exploratory new pharmaceuticals. Our empirical findings contribute to the theory of organisational learning and innovation by extending the theory of local search through uncovering more nuanced relationships between local search and subsequent exploratory innovation than those identified by prior works. © Imperial College Press."

The research objective is approached from the customers' viewpoint, in terms of their motivation to make sacrifices in learning and to embark on value co-creation with a service provider. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a qualitative case study. The main source of data is 17 interviews with retailers who tested a new m-advertising service. Findings: The findings show that the customer's motives to make sacrifices, their absorptive capacity and exploitative/explorative learning orientation are important in explaining the role of learning in value co-creation, because perceived value can vary significantly depending on the level of the absorptive capacity of the firm, the orientation towards learning, and the customer's sacrifices in learning. Practical implications: The study can be of use to providers of new technological business services in showing how to persuade customers to learn to use the service and engage in value co-creation. This is important since the active participation of both actors is required to co-produce the technological B2B service. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing value theory by offering new critical insights into the essential role of customer learning in value co-creation. Closely related to this, the study explores customer motivation to make sacrifices in learning and to get involved in value co-creation with service provider, specifically in the context of new technological B2B services. In so doing, this study offers empirically-based insights into value co-creation and thus advances the current understanding of value phenomena. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"The problem with knowledge ambiguity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899919843&doi=10.1016%2fj.emj.2013.07.010&partnerID=40&md5=ab40e73955e1c2b661b7422d38585ece","This paper proposes a new conceptualisation of the construct of knowledge ambiguity. This new conceptualisation is essential because (1) past researchers have tended to narrowly define and operationalise knowledge ambiguity in terms of causal ambiguity or tacitness and (2) the prevalent non-comprehensive conceptualisation constrains our ability to overcome the problem of knowledge ambiguity. Knowledge ambiguity has been identified as a major obstacle to effective knowledge transfer and to the implementation of overall knowledge management systems. The new conceptualisation proposes that knowledge ambiguity is composed of two types of ambiguity: component ambiguity and causal ambiguity. Component ambiguity is uncertainty about knowledge content, whereas causal ambiguity is uncertainty about how to use the knowledge. This re-conceptualisation is supported by previous studies on knowledge characteristics, absorptive capacity and cognitive learning. In this paper, theoretical propositions are developed to demonstrate the compatibility of the new conceptualisation with the current understanding of these concepts. The present paper not only advances our understanding of knowledge ambiguity, it also points towards solutions for overcoming the problems associated with knowledge ambiguity. Different measures are required to overcome problems created by component ambiguity vs. causal ambiguity. This paper's re-conceptualisation of knowledge ambiguity makes it easier to theorise about and operationalise the concept. It aligns the definition of knowledge ambiguity with current definitions of related constructs such as absorptive ambiguity and cognitive learning that are used in the broader knowledge transfer and knowledge management literatures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

In public sector services, innovation is a frequent, often holistic, and multi-layered process that involves many actors and many services at the same time. However, most of the existing literature on innovation in public sector services is based on the economics of innovation, which is heavily influenced by investigations of the private sector. Innovation in the Public Sector develops a more context-sensitive and rich approach in order to explore the different logics of innovation that prevail here. Rather than presenting a general theory of innovation, the book specifies how innovation and value creation are interconnected with social and institutional elements. Analytical constructs, including dynamic capability, absorptive capacity, and practice-based approaches, are reviewed and anchored in the organizational context of public sector services. Such a perspective on innovation can help us develop new understandings of the process and history of innovation, contributing to processual organizational analysis in a broader sense, and further developing present theories of organizational change. © 2014 Taylor and Francis."

Currently, one of the most significant issues is the role of the marketing function in the development of dynamic capabilities, and some recent discussions have even introduced the new term 'dynamic marketing capabilities'. The main area of interest is how to achieve a well-integrated framework to serve as the starting point for empirical papers. Although the most recent research proposes a wide range of processes as possible dynamic marketing capabilities, it is difficult to find consensus among these proposals. To resolve this difficulty, this paper seeks to define the dynamic marketing capabilities construct based on accepted components in the generic dynamic capabilities view. More specifically, it defines the role of dynamic marketing capabilities through absorptive capacity and knowledge management. By identifying these components and relating them in an integrative model, the authors propose to explain how dynamic marketing capabilities work and precisely which marketing processes promote both components. © 2013 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Comparing the different types of coordination instruments, this chapter shows that not only the person-oriented, but also the structural and technocratic coordination instruments relate positively with the achievement of technology transfer goals. The study finds stronger relationships between the traditional coordination instruments and the technology transfer goals than between the modern management concepts and the technology transfer goals.Originality/value - We believe that these results have important implications for the management of international technology transfers in particular and for the focus of future (international) management research in general. Future MNC research studies need to include traditional coordination instruments, since they continue to strongly influence organizational behavior and outcomes.

Special attention should be paid to the past three years of economic crisis, where a shift of existing economic paradigms has occurred. In order to navigate through these turbulent times, many companies, as an option to survive or expand, have formed cross-border alliances and cooperations. Due to these cross-border initiatives, the geographic movement of employees and, implicitly, the flow of intellectual capital, play an important role. Paradoxically, however, the process of knowledge transfer has been affected by several shortcomings, for example, the knowledge receiver's lack of absorptive capacity or cognitive learning, a knowledge applicability gap, or the rise of knowledge sharing barriers. The reason for this situation lies in the flawed knowledge transfer process. This approach is characterized by a unidirectional flow of knowledge from the West, reflecting an ethnocentric approach; inappropriate attitudes on behalf of the knowledge transmitter and the knowledge receiver; by knowledge not being culturally embedded, which leads to an alienation of knowledge; and, finally, to a lack of cultural awareness and preparedness on behalf of the westerners. This article applies a phenomenological approach. By using grounded theory, it contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of the problems and its implications on management from a multidisciplinary perspective. It provides solutions to improve the knowledge transfer process between eastern and western European cooperations based on an intercultural and reciprocal methodology and a new conducive learning environment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The framework incorporates certain characteristics of national business systems, particular inter-organizational ties developed with transnational or local carriers, and the potential absorptive capacity of the local organizations. By this way, it includes the effects of temporal interactions between different adoption decisions. The components of the framework are operationalized and tested within the Turkish setting by using the adoption data of three different management innovations: TQM, six sigma and lean production. The data is collected from a sample of 375 large-sized firms using a telephone-based interview protocol. While the findings provide satisfactory support for the framework as a whole, they also call attention to the relative differences in the explanatory power of each factor in accounting for the adoption of particular innovations. Variations among the explanatory factors can be attributed to the differences between the life-cycles of TQM, six sigma and lean production as well as to the relative divergence of their conceptual framing. © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press."

By contrast, strategic management studies in advanced countries center on the 'internal' sources of organizational learning and routines (including R&D) within a firm, aimed at developing and renewing its knowledge and its absorptive capacity. This paper draws from both groups of studies to examine how latecomer firms accumulate in-house knowledge bases and assimilate foreign knowledge to create strategic innovation capabilities. We propose a clear three-stage development framework to examine two leading firms, AU Optronics (AUO) and Chimei Innolux (CMI), in Taiwan's flat panel display industry. This paper shows the coevolution of the firms' knowledge bases and external foreign sources of knowledge over time. We find that, with their increasing knowledge bases and strategic advancement over time, the firms are able to benefit from knowledge transfer; to build up their high-level innovative capabilities, and in the process to move from junior to senior status with foreign firms. These developments appear to allow leading firms to move 'across' the technological frontier, contributing to a strengthening competitive position in the international market. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile payment has been emerging as a noticeable phenomenon that can enable consumers to turn their smartphones into digital wallets. Although there has been a lot of coverage on consumer acceptance of mobile payments, there are only few researches providing guideline to interpret NFC-based mobile payments adoption. Taking into consideration of theoretical backgrounds of innovation diffusion and specific characteristics of NFC mobile payments, this study propose a research framework to provide a profound understanding of factors facilitating or impeding the adoption of NFC-based mobile payments among Taiwanese consumers. This study expects that intention to adopt NFC mobile payments is affected by product-related factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, perceived security and privacy risk, trialability, perceived cost of use and additional value of NFC mobile payment), trust-based factors, personal-related factors (personal innovativeness in new technologies, absorptive capacity), and attractiveness of alternatives. This study will be able to advance literature on innovation adoption and facilitate technology marketers in NFC mobile payments. It provides a useful guideline to help researchers investigate of issues related to NFC mobile payments. It also bring some managerial implications by assisting relevant parties in NFC mobile payments ecosystem such as mobile network operators, card issuers, payment processing institutions, bank decision makers and merchants when devising their business strategies and marketing campaigns to facilitate NFC mobile payments. © 2014 PICMET."

Specifically, it aims to explore the nature and types of knowledge gaps, to capture their changes and to shed some light on the processes of filling knowledge gaps. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on two case studies and adopts a processual approach. It analyses 40 years of data collected using secondary sources and semi-structured interviews over a period of two years and identifies critical organizational events both in retrospect and real time. Findings: The findings show that the two case study companies have identified a number of knowledge gaps over the 40 years period. Changes in the nature and type of knowledge gaps are identified and discussed in detail leading to a new taxonomy of organisational knowledge gaps. The findings report that knowledge gaps emerge due to changes in both exogenous and endogenous conditions over time. The filling of those gaps depends on a number of factors. Among these, the ability to make a distinction between ""strategic"" and ""imposed"" knowledge gaps and the ability to build absorptive capacity within a stipulated time frame have a predominant role. Research limitations/implications: The respondents were asked to look back into the history of their company using their memory of events to provide explanations surrounding critical organizational events. Since some of the respondents had not witnessed all of the events in question, their responses were at times based on hearsay. However, every effort was made to check the authenticity of the respondents' explanations, such as using a range of sources and discussing the events with respondents at different hierarchical levels of the company. Practical implications: This study provides examples of knowledge in practice and puts forward a new taxonomy of knowledge gaps which can help managers to deal with imposed and strategic knowledge requirements. Specifically, this study equips managers with tools on how to devise their knowledge strategy, how to identify their knowledge requirements and what are different sources (internal and external) which they can explore to fill those knowledge gaps. Originality/value: The paper builds on the strategy in practice perspective, which stresses the need for further studies to link theoretical frameworks with practical solutions. In this respect, this paper attempts to make sense of organizational knowledge theory by applying it in real life business situations and by unearthing the concept and usage of knowledge gaps. The use of a retrospective processual approach to study changes in organizational knowledge requirements over time is another interesting aspect of this research. Finally, the paper provides a new taxonomy of organizational knowledge gaps. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The positive impact of rivals' R&D on a firm's profits is known as knowledge spillovers. On the other hand, an innovating firm will not be able to price a new product to fully capture the value of its innovation due to competition. Furthermore, there are times when a rival's innovation activities might make a firm's products obsolete. This results in negative spillovers, in which case rivals' R&D hurts a firm's performance. The interplay of knowledge and negative spillovers together determines the direction of the overall impact of rivals' R&D on the firm's stock valuation. We provide evidence that rivals' R&D is significantly and positively associated with stock valuation of firms. To our best knowledge, ours is the first study to show a positive association between R&D expenditures of rivals and firm's stock market valuation. We further show that the impact of industry R&D on stock valuation is higher in industries where R&D expenditures are dispersed among several firms compared to industries where R&D is concentrated among a few firms. Finally, we show that investors differentiate firms based on their absorptive capacity of rivals' R&D."

Banking development quality is measured using two standardized intermediation cost indicators and an index of banking development quality that is constructed based on the following indicators: overhead costs to total assets and net interest margin. The results for developed countries show that, on its own, FDI is negatively related to economic growth. However, when FDI is interacted with a banking development quality index, the quality of banking development is found to play a positive role in influencing the effects of FDI on economic growth. This suggests that the quality of banking development serves as an absorptive capacity that allows developed countries to benefit from the positive growth effects of FDI. On the contrary, for emerging countries, the findings indicate that banking development quality plays no role in influencing the impact of FDI on economic growth. This implies that the quality of banking development in emerging countries has yet to reach a level that allows it to importantly influence the growth effects of FDI."

The result shows that: (1) The R&D cooperation of enterprises with research institutes has significant positive effects on their patent applications and output value of new products, while the cooperation with universities has significant negative impacts. In contrast, the R&D cooperation between universities and research institutes has positive influences on each other's publications and patent applications; however, their R&D cooperation with enterprises has negative effects. (2) For enterprises and universities, the absorptive capacity significantly moderates the impact of R&D cooperation on their innovation performance; when the absorptive capacity is at a lower level, enterprises and universities would get more benefits from R&D cooperation. However, for research institutes, their absorption capacity has no significant moderating role on R&D cooperation and innovation performance.

There are also companies who follow the defensive strategy, i.e., develop generic drugs. We focus on the issue how knowledge-related capabilities can be utilised when trying to profit from innovations. The larger the knowledge pool to be used by the companies, the higher is the probability to profit from new innovation. This is one of the greatest motivations to establish strategic research networks. However, the more innovative the offensive companies are the more opportunities there are also for defensive companies. We tackle this innovation race by a simulation model that scrutinises the profitability of research networks in the three company world where tacitness, legal appropriability means, and absorptive capacities are used as means of technology strategies. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

We argue that firms with higher levels of absorptive capacity manage external knowledge flows more efficiently and stimulate innovative outcomes. And in a cluster with more trust between the firms, firms will achieve higher innovative performance through outbound open innovation. What's more, we discuss open innovation in firms of labor-intensive, capital-intensive and technology-intensive industrial clusters, respectively. We argue that sourcing and revealing are more popular than acquiring and selling in firms of labor-intensive clusters. However, acquiring and sourcing are both very popular while revealing is more popular than selling in firms of capital-intensive and technology-intensive clusters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

In particular, a context that is rich in knowledge generates entrepreneurial opportunities from those ideas. By commercializing ideas that evolved from an incumbent organization via the creation of a new firm, the entrepreneur (human capital) not only serves as a conduit for the spillover of knowledge, but also for the ensuing innovative activity and enhanced economic performance through resource allocation. The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship brings together contemporary theories and thoughts of entrepreneurship with prevailing theories of economic growth, geography, and strategy and therefore explains not just why some people choose to become an entrepreneur, but also why this matters significantly for the economy and society. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Little, however, is known about the role of business model in knowledge acquiring activities of the firms. Therefore, by incorporating the cognitive and reified activity-based view of business model into the knowledge-based view (KBV) and absorptive capacity of the firms, this article attempts to address this deficiency. The author posits that business model is a holistic framework in the mind of the executives. It is embodied and reified in activities which employees and particularly executives perform to create and capture value for the firm. In light of this perspective knowledge acquisition is conceived as a key strategic activity whose scope, depth, and breadth are regulated by the business model of the firm. Adding to and extending KBV, this manuscript offers several contributions to theory and practice. Given this analysis, contributions of this view are presented, implications for theory and practice are discussed, and some fruitful areas for future research are highlighted. © 2013, IGI Global."

The chapter reviews the literature, models, and frameworks related to knowledge absorptive capacity. The chapter utilizes a qualitative content analysis as an explanation method in case study research to validate the proposed model. The chapter then analyzes Korean firms as a case in point to illustrate how Korean firms have built their knowledge absorptive capacity. The model consists of four stages: 1) knowledge initiation, 2) knowledge imitation, 3) knowledge improvement, and finally, 4) knowledge innovation or 4KI. The framework shows four development stages at Korean firms as: 1) entrance of foreign companies into the Korean market and their reluctance to transfer their knowledge and information sharing to Korean firms, initiating its knowledge absorptive capacity, 2) Korean firms started knowledge absorptive capacity by means of imitating knowledge from external (especially foreign firms), 3) it then developed knowledge absorptive capacity by means of improving external knowledge, and finally, 4) capability to create their own knowledge and becoming one of the leading economy in the world which challenges firms from advanced countries in the global market. The chapter also highlights the developmental changes in the electronics industry of Korea. Keeping past experiences in consideration, the authors conclude that this model provides useful implications for developing economies, known as latecomers following the same pattern of KAC. © 2014 by IGI Global.

The multidimensional theoretical construct of absorptive capacity and the evolutionary economics concept of organisational routines are used to analyse 14 case studies of innovative not-for-profit ventures in Australia and the UK.

They can overcome this liability by learning vicariously from the knowledge of incumbent firms. But how can entrants learn from external knowledge when they lack the prior related knowledge that forms the basis of absorptive capacity? We theorize that the process of internal experiential learning facilitates learning from external knowledge, particularly for entrants. To test this theory, we examine learning using a comprehensive set of U.S. commercial banking firms, including a full census of entrants. Our estimates suggest that the share of vicarious learning realized in the process of experiential learning is twice as large for entrants as for incumbents. In this sense, entrants enjoy an ""advantage of newness"" in learning. © 2013 INFORMS."

In addition, we draw on organizational learning theory and the concept of absorptive capacity (AC) to articulate the mechanisms through which these systems might influence market responsiveness and firm innovativeness. We develop and validate measures of FHRM systems using a series of four independent samples. Our findings based on a sample of high-technology firms indicate that FHRM systems are positively associated with firm-level potential and realized AC and that potential AC, in turn, is positively associated with market responsiveness and firm innovativeness. © The Author(s) 2012."

Based on a survey of 212 Chinese firms, this study finds that in addition to their individually positive effects, knowledge creation capability and absorptive capacity have a synergistic effect on product innovativeness. Moreover, the individual effect of knowledge creation capability and the synergistic effect become stronger as technological turbulence increases, whereas the impact of absorptive capacity tends to be dampened by technological turbulence.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and RADMA."

Results from a publicly traded sample show that firms failing to meet aspirations (i.e., those with motivation) are more likely to acquire, as are firms that have a high absorptive capacity (i.e., those with ability). Most interestingly, absorptive capacity moderates the influence of performance shortfalls in the decision to acquire and is most important when the motivation to acquire is low. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

The empirical basis of the conceptual framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of Zhejiang Institute of Modern Textile Industry, an innovation intermediary that greatly facilitates knowledge spillover, application and integration in the Shaoxing Textile industrial cluster in China. This case analysis shows that an innovation intermediary can play the roles of technology gatekeeper, technology spanner, technical problem solver, and innovation resource integrator within the knowledge system of an industrial cluster. In addition, examining the process of intermediation reveals that absorptive capacity, knowledge complexity, presence of a structural hole and network centrality are critical to the role in which innovation intermediaries function within the knowledge systems of industrial clusters. © 2013 © 2013 Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME)."

This paper links knowledge input using new product introductions (NPI), to commercial output, addressing one of the key criticisms of research and development expenditures as a measure of an organization's effort. We propose that firms with a strong basic science foundation such as biology and chemistry seek to advance their scientific knowledge in addition to developing and selling innovative products. In contrast, corporations with a more applied focus forego fundamental scientific advancement and concentrate their actions on the development of innovative products. Results from a sample of 487 firms over a 10-year period indicated that firms with an applied science foundation had greater numbers of NPIs, both breakthrough and innovative, suggesting that a solutions-based approach had greater value in terms of innovative output. The pursuit of science may build knowledge, but a clear link between increased ACAP and innovative output was not found. Our results also suggest that basic science firms have a positive relationship with both breakthrough and incremental NPIs using merger and acquisition activities. Applied science firms found university alliances useful in generating NPIs.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and RADMA."

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data from a sample of 118 business divisions were analyzed using stepwise linear regression. Findings: The results from a three-effect model for the analysis of knowledge transfer indicate that knowledge outflow improves division performance, while knowledge inflow damages it when absorptive capacity is weak. The overall effect of knowledge transfer is therefore beneficial with the exception of the cases of receiving divisions with low levels of absorptive capacity. Practical implications: These results indicate that knowledge transfer contributes to overall corporate performance, since knowledge outflow impacts positively on division performance in all cases and knowledge inflow impacts negatively on division performance only in some cases. Setting aside the obvious task of promoting knowledge transfer within the firm, one important concern for corporate officers would be to prevent situations in which a division lacks the absorptive capacity to play its role within a corporate network. Originality/value: This work contributes to existent literature by disentangling the effects of knowledge transfer according to different theoretical perspectives, and it provides an empirical examination in a setting which is intensive in knowledge transference, as is that of business divisions from related diversified firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

As many of these alliances fail, alliance management has to be taken into consideration. Investigating drivers and conditions for successful innovation alliances can thus be helpful for profound decisions by managers, especially from small enterprises, representatives of biotechnology clusters or politicians responsible for governmental incentives. Based on a large-scale survey in German biotechnology, this article provides new insights into alliance formation and success. The results show that collaborative innovation is very common to cope with industry-specific challenges. Suppliers of information and customers are frequently selected partners and many firms belong to regional clusters. Alliance formation is related to a firm's absorptive capacity and to cultural aspects which reflect the reluctance to open up the innovation process. Alliance success is positively related to absorptive capacity and negatively related to an ineffective protection of intellectual property. Measures to improve absorptive capacity, to reduce the reluctance to collaborate and to protect intellectual property are introduced and managerial implications are derived.

To reflect business strategy, we draw on Miles and Snow's typology. The information has been obtained based on a sample made up of 81 Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises. Results show that knowledge acquisition capacity is greater at prospectors than at defenders and analysers, and that transformation and exploitation capacities are greater at prospectors than at defenders.

PURPOSE:: The aim of this study was to test the utility of ACAP by analyzing health care administrators' experiences with multiple strategic initiatives within two health systems. METHODOLOGY:: Results are drawn from administrators' assessments of multiple initiatives within two health systems using in-depth personal interviews with a total of 61 health care administrators. Data analysis was performed following deductive qualitative analysis guidelines. Interview transcripts were coded based on the four dimensions of ACAP: acquiring, assimilating, internalizing/transforming, and exploiting knowledge. Furthermore, we link results related to utilization of management resources, including number of key personnel involved and time consumption, to dimensions of ACAP. FINDINGS:: Participants' description of multiple strategic change initiatives confirmed the importance of the four ACAP dimensions. ACAP can be a useful framework to assess organizational capacity with respect to the organization's ability to concurrently implement multiple strategic initiatives. This capacity specifically revolves around human capital requirements from upper management based on the initiatives' location or stage within the ACAP framework. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:: Strategic change initiatives in health care can be usefully viewed from an ACAP perspective. There is a tendency for those strategic initiatives ranking higher in priority and time consumption to reflect more advanced dimensions of ACAP (assimilate and transform), whereas few initiatives were identified in the ACAP ""exploit"" dimension. This may suggest that health care leaders tend to no longer identify as strategic initiatives those innovations that have moved to the exploitation stage or that less attention is given to the exploitation elements of a strategic initiative than to the earlier stages. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Using data from 222 manufacturing firms, we can show that the availability of a KMS in a firm affects its innovation success by contributing to its ACAP. Looking at the impact of different knowledge types on innovativeness, the results show that only technological knowledge is a substantial determinant of innovation success but not market knowledge. © Imperial College Press."

This study explores how leading Taiwanese latecomer firms acquired strong capabilities in the display (thin film transistor-liquid crystal display, TFT-LCD) industry. We identify how these firms acquired the technology base to catch up rapidly and move from one set of advanced products and technologies to another, focusing on both the accumulation of technological capabilities and the underlying absorptive capacity of each firm. Empirically, we distinguish three phases of capability building, namely pre-entry, entry, and innovation and diversification. Theoretically, we suggest that the notion of 'latecomer' absorptive capacity, centred on engineering and design rather than R&D, might explain both the rapidity of recent technological catch up and the diversification across products and technologies as latecomer firms approach the technology frontier. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis."

This study seeks to better understand the nature of successful technology transfer in Korea. We empirically analyzed the impact of the supplier's characteristics (cultural distance, relationship type, form of technology transfer, and licensing type) and the recipient's characteristics (absorptive capacity) on the market value of firms in Korea using the event study methodology. We found that technology transfer announcements significantly increase the market value of firms in Korea, and market responses to the recipient firms are significantly greater than those to the supplier firms. Our results showed that the effect of alliances with complementors (e.g., university, government laboratory) is greater than that of alliances with industry players, and the effect of an exclusive license as a method of technology transfer is greater than that of a non-exclusive license. However, we were not able to determine whether the impact of high levels of absorptive capacity is significantly different from that of low levels of absorptive capacity.

"Middle managers' role in transferring person-centered management and care","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885949047&doi=10.1080%2f02642069.2013.815738&partnerID=40&md5=57eaa4567eb3a139e9aa4d54e19915ae","This paper presents a study of the role of middle managers in the knowledge transfer related to a person-centered management and care approach at a physical rehabilitation center. This qualitative research comprises a multi-case study, representing the six middle managers of the organization studied. The main findings generated by this research indicate that despite top management's efforts to disseminate a person-centered approach throughout the organization, the knowledge transfer process mainly depends on the absorptive capacity of middle managers. When middle managers have the capacity to absorb the person-centered approach, often because it is compatible with their values and current practices, this capacity is expressed mainly through their behavioral exemplarity. The results of the study also engender an intervention model illustrating the key role of middle managers in the transfer of a person-centered management and care approach. The model includes macro- and micro-contextual elements that facilitate the transfer. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."
"Translation behaviour: An exploratory study within a service multinational","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879160209&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibusrev.2012.12.004&partnerID=40&md5=3fb5bf275829b11daaa7eb3ad7bd32e7","In this paper, we address the issue of translation behaviour in the context of a service multinational. Our case study of a Nordic bank shows that emergent translation needs may be handled by the organisation and the individual in various ways such as self-translation, technical translation tools, social networks, or the central translation department. The choice between these options is shaped by situational influences including growing language diversity, accuracy, response speed, cost considerations, confidentiality of the information and task criticality. A key finding is the importance of social networks as a coping mechanism for employees confronted with the need to provide timely translation solutions, including the resort to external social networks, even relatives. Rather than a seemingly mundane, peripheral activity, translation was found to play a role in service delivery, organisational functioning and hence company performance. We propose a multilevel theoretical model of the translation process and conclude that organisation's translation ability which consists of organisational and individual responses should be considered as a component of its language absorptive capacity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 119 high involvement Mexican exporting firms through informants. Formative and reflective constructs were validated through MIMIC models and confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL. The theoretical model was tested using partial least squares (PLS). Findings: Results suggest that high involvement Mexican exporting firms' capacity to adapt through product design, technology management, manufacturing processes, and cooperative relationships impacts their innovation and market expansion-adaptation capabilities. Nurturing an entrepreneurship orientation is critical to build flexibility, transfer innovation to markets, and drive export performance. Ultimately, performance is determined by the firms' ability to design and develop products through the adoption of improved technologies, a deep understanding of international demands, and an ability to refocus exporting strategies as changes in competitive contexts require. Research limitations/implications: The design of exporting capabilities in this study only applies to high involvement exporting firms. Practical implications: High involvement exporting firms sustain growth through the development of exploration (learning), exploitation (expansion-adaptation), and dynamic (innovation, entrepreneurship) capabilities as determinant of performance. Originality/value: This is the first model that tests relationships among learning, manufacturing flexibility, and market expansion-adaptation and dynamic capabilities such as innovation and entrepreneurship and their impact on performance in high involvement Mexican exporting firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We build ad hoc indicators for these two concepts following a factor analysis methodology, and carry out a structural equations analysis to determine the relationship between them. Based on firm level data from a survey that focuses on SMEs of the machining industry in a Mexican locality, this paper argues that in a low-tech and mature sector, which operates in a loosely articulated local system, two knowledge spillover mechanisms are relevant - the backward linkages and the employees' mobility. SMEs' absorptive capacities are strongly influenced by organisational capabilities and innovation and learning activities. We also argue that large firms' knowledge spillovers are strongly correlated with SMEs' absorptive capacities within the sector and locality analysed."

The authors argue that an e-purchasing tool may not in itself positively influence performance unless combined with AC as a human interface to maximise its information and transactional improvement potential. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data collected from 297 procurement executives of large companies in ten countries are analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical moderated regression. Findings: The results demonstrate few significant direct effects of e-purchasing tools on category performance. All performance measures studied are enhanced when dimensions of AC and their interactions with the e-purchasing tools are added. Specifically, buyer competence, manager competence and communications climate have performance-enhancing effects. In some cases, AC on its own appears to increase performance more than e-tools. Originality/value: This paper is the first to study the moderating effects of AC on the relationship between e-purchasing tool usage and category performance. Its findings support the view that simply implementing technology does not lead to performance improvements, but that a human interface is required to maximise the information and transactional improvement potential of e-purchasing tools. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The aim of this paper is to present a model to reflect how technical IT skills and the use of IT in interdependent tasks may influence the development of organisational absorptive capacity, both potential and realised, which also affects organisational performance. Since knowledge constitutes one of the main resources for organisations to gain competitive advantages and helps firms to improve their organisational performance, absorptive capacity is a key factor in success. This model was tested empirically using a sample of 160 European technological firms. The results of our analysis suggest that the mastery of technical IT skills and the use of IT in interdependent tasks positively affect potential and realised absorptive capacities, which in turn enhances organisational performance.

The capability-based perspective suggests that absorptive capacity is leveraged through multiple underlying capabilities. The objective of this study is to examine and hypothesize relationships among the capabilities to strengthen the theoretical foundation of research on absorptive capacity. An investigation of firms in the software industry was conducted, and the findings suggest firms convert knowledge using four distinct capabilities. The four-capability model of absorptive capacity is shown to be an appropriate operationalization, and empirical results confirm a positive relationship with firm performance. The theoretically anchored and empirically tested model of absorptive capacity offers a unifying conceptualization intended to provide a foundation for future studies and advance the progression of absorptive capacity-related studies."

This paper therefore empirically explores the relationship between absorptive capacity (ACAP) and openness in the United States and European biopharmaceutical sectors. Based on analysis of data from a large-scale international survey of 349 biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, the results suggest that exploratory openness depends more strongly on the research and development (R&D) aspect of firms' potential absorptive capacity, whereas exploitative openness is more conditional on firms' realized absorptive capacity (RACAP). The results also highlight the major differences between firms' openness and ACAP in the United States and Europe - in the United States, firms' skill levels prove more significant in contributing to firms' engagement with exploratory relationships, whereas in Europe, continuity of R&D proves more important. Engagement with exploitative relationships, however, is more conditional on firms' RACAP in Europe only. © 2013 The Author. R&D Management © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and RADMA."

The development of technology parks at Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Kulim High Tech Park (KHTP) and Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is the focus of the discussion. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a self-administered survey to 300 local professionals; and 51 percent responded. A multiple regression was used to identify the significant determinants of transfer of knowledge. Findings: Knowledge transfer from foreign expatriate, parent and peer subsidiary companies to local professionals is at a moderate level. The overall multiple regression shows that workplace learning, personal time management, symptom of replication, adaptation and innovation, and work experience significantly contribute to the transferring of expertise to local professional employees. Research limitations/implications: The success of companies in today's competitive economy lies more in their knowledge and intellectual capital rather than other resources. Therefore, transferring new knowledge from foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) to local workforces is a basic step for future sustainable competitive advantage. Empirical evidence from previous research shows that information and communication technology can facilitate the transfer of knowledge. This is not covered in this study. Practical implications: Training mechanisms must be designed in such a way to promote in-plant training or employee attachment at the parent company or foreign peer subsidiaries. Originality/value: The paper shows that the success of knowledge transfer depends on the absorptive capacity, the organizational learning climate and the willingness of foreign expatriates in multinational corporations to transfer knowledge. This is an empirical indication of knowledge inflows within Malaysian technology parks, which is a relatively new topic to be explored. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The purpose of this paper is to provide conceptual tools and strategies for the growing number of managers, clinicians and decision makers navigating this arena. The authors conducted a narrative review to synthesise two streams of literature and examine evolving conceptual landscape concerning knowledge translation over the previous three decades. Conceptual mapping was used iteratively to develop and synthesise the literature. Iterative feedback from relevant research and practice stakeholder groups was used to focus and strengthen the review. KT has been conceptualised along three competing frames; one focusing on linear (largely unidirectional) transfer of knowledge; one focusing on KT as a social process; and another that seeks to more fully incorporate contextual issues in understanding research implementation. Three overlapping themes are found in the management literature that inform these debates in the health literature, namely knowledge boundaries, organisational learning and absorptive capacity. Literature on knowledge boundaries problematizes the nature of boundaries and the stickiness of knowledge. Organisational learning conceptualises the need for organisational wide systems to facilitate learning processes; it also draws on a more expansive view of knowledge. Absorptive capacity focuses at the firm level on the role of developing organisational capabilities that enable the identification, assimilation and use of new knowledge to enable innovation. The paper highlights the need to consider KT processes at multiple levels, including individual, organisational and strategic levels. These are important not only for research but also have practical implications for individuals and organisations involved in KT processes. This review summarises and integrates two largely separate literature streams on knowledge translation – namely health services research and management scholarship. In addition to outlining and organising the conceptual landscape around knowledge transfer, the paper contributes by highlighting how management literature on knowledge and learning theories might inform health services research on knowledge translation. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

In contrast to mainstream thinking on absorptive capacity, but in line with prevailing international business theory, our research supports the proposition that perceptions of procedural justice, rather than absorptive capacity, determine effectiveness, especially in cases of high tacit knowledge transfers. • Data was collected from senior ICT representatives in 86 Canadian subsidiaries of foreign owned MNEs. Each of these subsidiaries recently experienced a significant ICT transfer imposed by the parent organization. • Support was found for the main propositions: Procedural justice significantly predicted successful ICT transfer and adoption, while absorptive capacity was not significant. These findings are consistent even when knowledge tacitness was high. • The perceived success of the ICT transfer as well as its adoption varied widely across these firms. The potential reasons for this divergence in effectiveness are manifold, but our findings suggest that in situations of substantial knowledge tacitness, a higher level of procedural justice, rather than a higher level of absorptive capacity, is critical to effective transfer and adoption. • © 2012 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden."

This path allows organizations to identify IT Business Value and take advantage of it. The book synthesizes the main approaches that have emerged in recent years, compares these approaches along multiple variables, and finally proposes an advanced and new approach to Information Governance, based on the concept of Organizational Absorptive Capacity. Furthermore, the book presents a new approach to Information Management: the SIGMA (Strategic Information Governance Modelling and Assessment) approach. The new approach is centered on information as a key factor allowing integration between IT applications, organizational capabilities and business strategy. In particular, the Absorptive Capacity concept is presented and discussed: this concept represents the ability of an organization to maintain and absorb the potential of information and IT investments. After having presented and discussed the model, we also provide the reader with a brief presentation of how the SIGMA approach should be applied in companies.

It hypothesizes that (a) the assessment of regional spillovers relies on a detailed analysis of these effects, according to the channels by which they occur (namely, increasing competition, worker mobility, and demonstration effects); (b) the size and the extent of these effects depend on the interaction between their channels and the levels of existing technological capacity of local firms; and (c) spillover benefits tend to occur in regions where local firms largely invest in absorbing the best foreign knowledge. Using detailed firm-level manufacturing data from Switzerland, we have found that local firms gain from the presence of foreign firms in their region, but lose out if the firms are located elsewhere. Competition-related spillovers appear to be fully absorbed by local firms, with high technological capacities; worker-mobility-related spillovers are fully absorbed by low technology firms; while demonstration-related spillovers are absorbed by all groups of firms with mid technology firms experiencing the larger benefit. In addition, our results demonstrate that only local firms which have invested largely in the absorptive capacity benefit from spillovers, stemming mainly from technology transfer. This benefit seems to occur at both regional level and outside. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Considering the lack of advancement in the area in practice, this study offers a deeper understanding of dimensions that help to explain top management's knowledge of IT governance. Using absorptive capacity as its theoretical underpinning, and based on Australian empirical data, this study shows that for top management to achieve higher levels of absorptive capacity of IT governance knowledge (ACAP-ITG), they need to focus on four dimensions: prior relevant knowledge, effective communication network, appropriate communication climate, and effective knowledge scanning. To further support the usefulness of the ACAP-ITG construct, this study empirically tested the relationship between the construct and corporate performance. This study presents top management in organizations with useful measures that can help them assess their organization's strengths and weaknesses related to ACAP-ITG."

A novel post acquisition integration approach, namely light-touch integration, is investigated, and supported by newly assembled empirical evidence in the context of Chinese M&A in Germany. Light-touch integration essentially synthesizes the preservation and symbiosis integration approaches due to the contextual characteristics of Chinese cross-border M&A, such as cultural influences and the learning perspective.

The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptions undertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to compete in competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms that are conducive to the development of subsidiary absorptive capacity.

"Strategic renewal over time: The enabling role of potential absorptive capacity in aligning internal and external rates of change","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879838399&doi=10.1016%2fj.lrp.2012.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=1493886574adfc3a2f66191833473067","Top managers of multinational corporations are increasingly confronted with an accelerating rate of change in the external environment. Yet strategic renewal literature has devoted limited attention to the organizational mechanisms enabling firms to align internal with external rates of change, so as to achieve a dynamic firm-environment fit over time. This paper addresses that gap by taking a knowledge-based perspective. We develop a framework clarifying how a firm's potential absorptive capacity enables it to align internal with external rates of change. We illustrate the framework empirically by analyzing the rate of change in strategic renewal actions of Royal Dutch Shell as an indicator of the company's internal rate of change in the period 1980-2007, and by comparing it with external rates of change in the oil industry over the same period. The findings show that Shell's potential absorptive capacity was positively related to the alignment of internal and external rates of change. In addition, we find evidence that the degree of alignment was positively related to the company's performance during the observation period. Our study implies that managers who are aiming to align internal and external rates of change over time should: 1) monitor external rates of change through environmental scanning and boundary spanning, 2) create shared understanding of the long-term implications of change, 3) identify drivers of internal rates of change and understand how to pace the rate of strategic renewal actions, and finally, 4) maintain baseline levels of potential absorptive capacity, since increasing potential absorptive capacity takes time and requires a long-term perspective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

However, there is little research to discuss how overseas R&D centers absorb locational advantages of the host countries and, in turn, enhance their innovation performance. Through literature reviews, this paper examines absorptive capacity and synthesizes four types of locational advantages: (1) industrial clusters, (2) talent pool, (3) research base, and (4) government support. Then, a system dynamic model of locational advantage-absorptive capacity-innovation performance is proposed. Via MOEA's MNE R&D Center Program Database and interviews with top managers of MNE R&D centers, the dataset of 38 MNEs R&D centers from 2003 to 2008 is gathered. The systemic dynamic simulations reveal: (1) all four absorptive capacities corresponding four locational advantages positively influence innovation performance of R&D centers; (2) government subsidy significantly increases R&D hires, and R&D networks with local innovative actors. Finally, some managerial and policy implications for MNEs R&D subsidiaries to absorb locational advantages in Taiwan are provided."

(2006) to examine relationships between ACs sub-dimensions with NPD performance, and also their moderating effects on the relationship between supplier involvement and new product development performance, on both financial and nonfinancial aspects. Data from a survey of 161 manufacturing firms are used to test the developed hypotheses using structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression.

Data were collected from a survey of 279 Australian Logistics and Transport operators and analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that enhancing green logistics knowledge exploitation is important to improve GLP. This can be achieved through changing the logistics operations and incorporating new knowledge into green practices in a way that can reduce CO2 emission, fuel consumption, or the cost of environmental compliance. The findings also show that addressing environmental concerns requires a process in which environmental information, through a wide range of channels and practices, is acquired, assimilated, transformed, and exploited.

Specifically, the paper focuses on software firms doing business with the Open Source Software (OSS) community (OSS firms). It explores the antecedents of the adoption by OSS firms of a quite popular organisational practice: authorising firm programmers to contribute autonomously during their working hours to OSS projects to which their employers do not contribute on their own behalf. We argue that this practice serves the purpose of scouting the OSS community for new knowledge by leveraging the individual-level absorptive abilities of programmers. Accordingly, we expect the likelihood of its adoption is higher for the OSS firms that: i) must rely on the individual-level abilities of their programmers to acquire and assimilate new knowledge from the OSS community as they have smaller firm-level potential absorptive capacity; ii) are able to transform and exploit effectively the new knowledge in-sourced by their programmers as they have greater firm-level realised absorptive capacity. The econometric results based on data from 293 European OSS firms provide support to our hypotheses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The study is based on 86 personal interviews with 60 expatriate managers in 4 British subsidiaries belonging to 4 Taiwanese multinational corporations. The findings reveal how the ability and motivation of expatriates affect transfer stickiness both in terms of their absorptive capacity as an HRM knowledge recipient and their disseminative capacity as an HRM knowledge source. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."

Drawing from the absorptive capacity perspective, organizational inertia theory, and open innovation, the authors seek to argue that dynamic innovation capabilities have a curvilinear effect on breakthrough innovation that is moderated by open innovation activities. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey was sent to the top 1,000 firms in Taiwan, the target respondents being senior managers with experience in developing at least three successful breakthrough innovations in the past five years. A total of 218 usable questionnaires were collected, resulting in a respondent rate of 22.9 percent. Findings: The findings support the argument that dynamic innovation capabilities have an inverted U-shape relationship with breakthrough innovation. Meanwhile, open innovation activities strengthen the positive effects of dynamic innovation capabilities on breakthrough innovation. Research limitations/implications: The findings enrich the existing literature by proposing and confirming empirically that open innovation activities help firms with effective coordination of dynamic innovation capabilities. Practical implications: Managers must be aware of the limitations of their existing dynamic innovation capabilities in terms of developing breakthrough innovation. Originality/value: This study not only resolves the conflicting views about the relationship between dynamic capabilities and innovation but also adds to the existing literature that indicates the failure of leading firms in the face of rapid environmental change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an in-depth qualitative study of the knowledge transfer process undertaken by a sample of six global knowledge intensive service firms, to use knowledge transfer as a means of customer development. Findings: The results of this study suggest that customer absorptive capacity influences the role that knowledge for customers has in ultimately determining whether customer development will occur. Where tacit knowledge transfer occurs, it is restricted to loyal, high share customers. With respect to methods of transfer, the findings reveal that knowledge-intensive business service firms transferring explicit knowledge utilise both formal and informal methods. Research limitations/implications: Data collection was cross-sectional and longitudinal research would have the benefit of examining how customer knowledge transfer changes over time during the customer development process (pre-sale, during sale and post-sale customer development). Future research studying other types of knowledge transfer, such as during-sale and after-sale knowledge transfer, are also encouraged. Practical implications: Managers should be open to employing numerous types of media in transferring both explicit and tacit knowledge rather than restricting themselves to the normative ""explicit-formal-media lean"" versus ""tacit-informal-media rich"" categorisations in the literature. Originality/value: Understanding the role of customer knowledge transfer in the development of existing organisational customers is particularly important in the context of knowledge intensive business service firms. The extant literature recognises that customer development efforts are critically important in increasing service adoption and firm performance but there exists a dearth of research on customer knowledge transfer in the context of professional service organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In this study, mental and behavioral factors, such as the prestige and reputation of individual and the movement for people within the organization, are introduced to examine their impact on knowledge transferring between individuals. A conceptual model is proposed which involves two actors in the process of knowledge transfer, knowledge sender and knowledge recipient, their corresponding disseminative capacity and absorptive capacity, as well as mental and behavioral factors. Accordingly, a network model is constructed in which nodes act as the knowledge senders or recipients. The process of knowledge transfer on the network is inspected from two mental aspects-the prestige and reputation of individuals. The degree of impact of the factors on knowledge disseminative will or knowledge absorptive will of actors is measured. A personnel movement mechanism is also introduced to simulate the dynamic processes of knowledge transfer within the organization. The simulation results show that the positive mental factors for individuals can promote the disseminative capacity of knowledge senders, accelerate the processes of knowledge transfer, and improve the knowledge stock of the organization. © 2013, IGI Global."

These ideas can advance technology and lead to competitive advantage, thereby improving a firm's performance. However, the process of turning innovative ideas into performance does depend on firms' innovation capabilities. In this study, we first divide 'openness' into external openness, a search for external channels of information used to innovate, and internal openness, a kind of open culture within a firm. In order to balance value capture with openness, the power of openness in terms of value creation is largely supported by innovation capabilities, including the inherent characteristics of knowledge resources, absorptive capacity, and an entrepreneurial orientation. Our main goals are to state explicitly how a firm's openness strategies influence its innovation capabilities, and explore how to advance innovation capabilities through openness in order to improve performance. Therefore, we use an international and cross-industry survey which was executed by the Managing Innovation in the New Economy (MINE) program. Based on data from 393 firms, our results show that the innovation capabilities of these firms derive from the accumulation of external openness and internal openness. In addition, the findings of this study confirm the role of innovation capabilities in mediating the effect of openness strategies on firms' performance. On the whole, this investigation demonstrates the value of external openness and internal openness to promoting favorable managerial decisions. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

This research was conducted in North Sulawesi which has excellent economic growth by involving small and medium enterprises. The results show that knowledge donating and knowledge collecting positively influence SME's innovation capabilities if absorptive capacity is also developed. In other words, the result of the research gives us empirical evidence that new knowledge created from knowledge sharing can be transformed into innovation capabilities if it is supported by higher absorptive capacity."

Absorptive capacity is argued to be essential for this transformation, since it can facilitate the prediction of new technology trends and the assimilation and application of new knowledge to produce new commercial outputs. The investigation of the relationships between absorptive capacity, technological entrepreneurship and their impact on Guangdong technology firms' performance is the purpose of this study. Design/methodology/approach: In this aim a positive causal chain from absorptive capacity to technological entrepreneurship and from this latter to performance is tested through a mediation analysis, which uses an ordinary least squares regression-based path analytical framework for estimating indirect effects on a sample of 113 Guangdong technology-based firms. Findings: Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that greater absorptive capacity leads to greater technological entrepreneurship, which in turn leads to greater performance. Therefore evidence is provided about both the mediating role of technological entrepreneurship and the role of absorptive capacity as its antecedent in relation to Guangdong-based technology firms' performance. Originality/value: A relevant but somewhat neglected relationship is examined using an integrative model in the Guangdong context. Moreover the study uses direct measures of absorptive capacity as a capability and provides a firm-level operationalization of technological entrepreneurship. In so doing it also adopts state-of-the-art analysis techniques and highlights the relevance of investments in soft factors for Guangdong technology firms' path towards excellence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Based on data from 285 technology-based small and medium enterprises, we observe gains within three prospective, secondary measures of growth to diminish beyond lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful beyond intermediate levels. We find that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) moderates the ACAP-performance relationship, enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP. Further, with higher EO, higher ACAP can be achieved before financial returns diminish.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The aim is to develop a taxonomy that can predict a firms performance with regard to innovation and operational efficiency. This research complements the literature, which presently focuses on descriptive rather than predictive taxonomies. Data from 153 firms were collected through survey research. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the quality of data and calculate composite scores to be used in the cluster analysis to develop the BSRs patterns. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationships between BSR type and firm performance. Finally, semi-structured interviews aided interpretation of the proposed taxonomy. Findings support the identification of groups of dyads through different combinations of the learning processes underlying AC. The different combinations are typified through AC strength and AC reinforcement. The results provide evidence of a significant relationship between AC strength and firm performance. Surprisingly, we did not find empirical support for the relationship between AC reinforcement and performance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

A large scale survey was sent out to Swedish manufacturing companies and the data was analysed using hierarchical regression. The results show that it is not manufacturing competence per se that increases new product development (NPD) efficiency, but rather how the competence is leveraged through various integration mechanisms.

We address this question by examining an important, demand-side barrier to licensing - the buyers' cost of integrating a licensed technology. We argue that this cost can be affected by suppliers' knowledge transfer capabilities, buyers' absorptive capacity, and the cospecialization between R&D and downstream activities in the buyers' industries. Following this argument and a stylized bargaining model, we hypothesize that the supplier's knowledge transfer capability stimulates licensing. Moreover, the importance of this capability increases when licensing to industries where potential buyers have weak absorptive capacity or R&D and downstream activities are cospecialized. We find support for our hypotheses using a panel dataset of small 'serial innovators. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Particularly for SMEs, research cooperation and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, they also bring in their wake requirements in terms of absorptive capacity and managerial skills of the internal R&D personnel. The paper focuses on the different requirements in terms of availability and training of research managers and R&D experts for research cooperation versus R&D outsourcing in SMEs. An empirical analysis of micro-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium reveals that the relation between R&D personnel requirements and research collaboration and R&D outsourcing depends upon the SME size. Therefore, to study this subject appropriately a distinction between very small, small, and medium-sized firms is relevant. Very small firms engage significantly less in research cooperation than medium-sized firms and the propensity to engage in research cooperation is positively associated with the share of PhD holders among the research managers and R&D experts. For R&D outsourcing a lower involvement is noted in medium-sized firms, and the propensity to outsource increases with the formal qualification level of the R&D personnel and with R&D training. Among the SME, small firms are most engaged in research cooperation and in R&D outsourcing. In the case of research cooperation they rely on highly qualified experts. For R&D outsourcing activities both the presence of research managers and R&D experts is important. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Revenue exhaustibility raises medium-term issues of how to sustain capital built during a windfall, while revenue volatility raises short-term concerns about macroeconomic instability. Using the model, country applications show how combining public investment with a resource fund - a sustainable investing approach - can address the problems associated with exhaustibility and volatility. The applications also demonstrate how the model can be used to determine the appropriate magnitude of the investment scaling-up (accounting for the financing needs to sustain capital) and the adequate size of a stabilization fund (buffer). © 2013 International Monetary Fund."
"Nurturing employee market knowledge absorptive capacity through unified internal communication and integrated information technology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874905836&doi=10.1016%2fj.im.2013.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=60cc1526a7c7525f0332aa8a3e5ca8c6","Organizations that are actively engaged in the dissemination of market information frequently question whether this effort improves employee information processing. We examined how the adoption of two integrative dissemination mechanisms, unified internal communication and information technology integration, is critical to enhancing employee market knowledge absorptive capacity. Using data from 211 industrial firms, we found that the existence of a greater market knowledge base and explicit market knowledge within firms determines the use of these mechanisms, which in turn increases employee absorptive capacity. Indeed, the mechanisms serve as full mediators for this ability, thus accentuating their value for knowledge, information technology, and innovation management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to check the research hypotheses with a sample of 249 Spanish industrial companies. Findings: The results show that organizational absorptive capacity and the firm's old knowledge positively affect exploitation of existing opportunities. In relation to the interaction between internal exploitation and firm performance, the results show a positive and significant effect. Finally, support was found for the hypothesis that there is a mediator effect of incremental innovation on the relationship between exploitation and organizational performance. Research limitations/implications: Self-reporting by the CEOs may be the most significant limitation since a single key informant provided the data; multiple informants would enhance the validity of the research findings. A second limitation is the cross-sectional design of the research that does not allow observation of the short- and long-term impact of the relationships among the variables; future research should use longitudinal studies. The study was also conducted in a specific national context with manufacturing firms. Practical implications: Competence exploitation has been argued to be less costly, highly rewarding and less risky that other orientations such as competence exploration. One of the main implications for managers is to assume that both absorptive capacity and organizational memory should be considered in parallel when conducting competence exploitation. The analysis sheds new light on the importance of incremental innovation in the process of enhancing performance. Originality/value: This paper studies some insufficiently investigated relationships concerning important managerial factors. It also presents a new model attempting to participate in the scientific debate about crucial issues such as the factors that can affect performance generation within the company. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Inclusion of these three constructs, and examining how IT- capability affects the relationships between these constructs, is essential to examining the role of IT in innovation at the firm-level.

The results suggest that technology diffusion from US foreign affiliates has a positive and significant impact on labor productivity only if host countries have a minimum level of human development. This condition may partially explain why previous studies show mixed support for the hypothesis that foreign affiliates have a positive effect on productivity in developing countries. Although the results have to be interpreted with caution, the policy implication is that human development enhances the capacity of countries to reap the benefits of foreign direct investments. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a cross-sectional design to test the relationships between potential absorptive capacity, three social integration mechanisms (cross-functional teams, participation in decision making, and self-managing teams), and realized absorptive capacity, in a sample of 92 organizations that bid competitively to provide products and services to a US university. Findings – An organization's use of cross-functional teams is negatively related to its realized absorptive capacity and negatively moderates the relationship between potential and realized absorptive capacity. Self-managing teams negatively moderate the relationship between an organization's potential absorptive capacity and its realized absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design allows tests of relatedness but does not support cause-and-effect inferences. Practical implications – Managers who follow the prescriptive implications of using social integration mechanisms to enhance their organization's absorptive capacity may actually hinder it. The type of social integration mechanism is an important consideration for managers of firm strategies. Originality/value – This study extends and challenges the literature on absorptive capacity through its empirical analysis of the role of social integration mechanisms on an organization's absorptive capacity. Social integration mechanisms can have mixed moderating effects on the absorptive capacity development process, and potential absorptive capacity is not easily transformed into realized absorptive capacity.

Both strategic management and strategic marketing theories have stressed the importance of continuously reinventing business models and creating new customer value. We extend these views by focusing on the impact of deliberate learning mechanisms on an organization's strategic innovation capacity. To this end, we re-interpret absorptive capacity through a cognition lens. A PLS analysis on survey data suggests that strategic innovation capacity is strengthened when managers deliberately install specific learning mechanisms on the three dimensions of absorptive capacity: knowledge recognition, assimilation and exploitation. Results complement existing research by indicating the importance of deliberate action when trying to break through existing industry practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

This paper explores how SMEs in peripheral regions can use knowledge management concepts and practices of knowledge acquisition and assimilation to achieve higher levels of innovation implementation. Survey findings indicate that more innovative firms are more likely to acquire or source external knowledge through various methods, and are more likely to have higher levels of absorptive capacity. Overall, the authors conclude that SMEs in peripheral regions can use knowledge acquisition and assimilation as antecedents to innovation to help overcome innate tangible resource limitations."

Design/methodology/approach: The study methodology involved two phases, viz. exploratory and descriptive. The exploratory phase, with the support of a focused literature survey, has resulted in a theoretical framework, which got later validated through the survey based empirical phase. Findings: The study results suggest that organizational learning and absorptive capacity could trigger a firm's technology acquisition intent, which in turn could increase the firm's propensity to new product commercialization. Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, the study results did not support firm size as an antecedent to the firm's technology acquisition intent. Further, while the project duration is found to negatively moderate the technology acquisition intent to new product commercialization relationship, the study results did not support the moderating effect of organizational inertia on the same. Practical implications: The study findings suggest that segmenting technology market based on firm size may not be an appropriate marketing strategy; instead organizational factors, viz. organizational learning and absorptive capacity, should be taken as the basis of high-tech market segmentation. Further, the study has provided the much needed empirical support to the new high-tech product development process by explaining the moderating effects of organizational inertia and project duration on the relationship between technology acquisition intent and new product commercialization. Originality/value: The present study is one among those rare empirical investigations that explained the role of organizational variables in the new high-tech product development process.

The challenges can be found at all three levels (core, ecosystem, and anatomy) within the innovation system. At the core level, communication and interaction between domestic technology developers and users have to be intensified. At the ecosystem level, it is more complicated for creating a favorable atmosphere for nurturing an effective and productive innovation system which will significantly contribute to economic growth and social welfare improvement. Hard challenges at the ecosystem level are to harmonize all regulations and public policies such that they are more in favor of innovation system development; and to synchronize prioritized programs and activities of all related public and private institutions. Deeper insight into each actor of innovation system and the challenges faced is required for advancing innovation. This analysis uses case methodology to identify these challenges. Scientific collaboration among technology developers is low; therefore, it could cause inefficient use of national R&D budget. In-house R&D activities and technology absorptive capacity of domestic industries are also low. Finally, the role of an intermediation agency is not yet significant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

We analyzed nine case studies of firms that introduced breakthrough business models by transferring and adapting characteristic business model components of other industries. Our results show that companies can facilitate cross-industry innovation on business model level through a process of abstraction, analogy identification and adaptation. Imitation is realized by deconstructing and mapping business model components based on their contribution to abstract, generic elements of the value proposition. We propose a systematic process model for business model innovation analyzing structural similarities between industries on the level of these abstract elements linked to specific other components of the business model. Firms can leverage this process by transformative learning processes, especially provided through a broad industrial and functional experience of members in business model innovation teams. © 2013 Imperial College Press."

Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology is followed, using not only semi-structured interviews but also secondary data to triangulate the obtained information. For the interviews, the authors have considered not only employees in different strategic positions, from middle management to top management, but also participants in the main supplier, to obtain a holistic perspective of the knowledge acquisition and appropriation in the innovation process. Findings: For the improvements of the process of knowledge acquisition and appropriation, organizations should configure internal and external networks to support this process reorganizing their classical structures. Moreover, this process is enhanced by the support of top managers and innovation champions, which act as sponsors and facilitators of the project respectively, to ensure that the whole process runs smoothly. At the end, to deal with new kinds of projects that are completely different to previous ones, it is recommended to be open to new ways of organizing and structuring participants; hence, coordination and socialization mechanisms are important to reach not only potential absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge acquisition) but also realized absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge exploitation). This situation is even more relevant in Web 2.0 environments, where each participant has autonomy to participate actively, be just a passive participant, or cease to belong to the community. Practical implications: The paper's findings could be useful to identify the determinants of knowledge acquisition and appropriation because they could guide organizations in the development of external and internal networks to support this process, which would be used to promote innovation within the organization; and with this identification, organizations could take actions based on their organizational requirements and goals. It is important to note that organizational boundaries are shifting from being closed to be permeable, enabling a better interaction with key partners and facilitating the knowledge exchange. However, this situation offers new challenges for organizations that want to be leaders in the near future because traditional organizations should shift their old paradigms, having an organizational culture more aligned with Web 2.0 philosophy (e.g. collaboration and sharing), which is the paradigm of the new digital economy. Originality/value: This study is a step forward to understand the relationship between external and internal networks that act as enablers of knowledge acquisition and appropriation. The authors extend the knowledge-based view by applying it in a Web 2.0 context, highlighting coordination and socialization mechanisms as critical success factors to integrate internal and external knowledge. Finally, the inclusion of interviews of employees from the main supplier of BBVA in these kinds of projects provides a holistic perspective of the process of knowledge acquisition and appropriation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Organizations invest large sums in various types of information technologies (ITs) to manage operational knowledge. Because of their superior storage, processing and communication capabilities, ITs offer technical platforms to build knowledge management (KM) capabilities. However, merely acquiring ITs are not sufficient, and organizations must structure information system (IS) designs to leverage ITs for building KM capabilities. We study how technical and strategic IS designs enhance operational absorptive capacity (OAC) - the KM capability of an operations management (OM) department. Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective of absorptive capacity to examine potential absorptive capacity (POAC) and realized absorptive capacity (ROAC) capabilities - the two OAC capabilities that create and utilize knowledge, respectively. Our theory proposes that integrated IS capability, - an aspect of technical IS design - is an antecedent of POAC and ROAC capabilities, and business-IT alignment - an aspect of strategic IS design - moderates the relationship between integrated IS capability and ROAC capability. Combining data gleaned from a multi-respondent survey with archival data from COMPUSTAT, we test our hypotheses using a dataset from 153 manufacturing organizations. By proposing that IS design enables an OM department's KM processes, i.e., the POAC and ROAC capabilities, our interdisciplinary theoretical framework opens the ""black box"" of OAC and contributes to improved understanding of IS and OM synergies.

As international competition continues to intensify,some companies and researchers have taken a profound interest in the social cognitions,reactions,backgrounds,and behaviors of members in organizations. In line with these tendencies,organizational culture,along with absorptive capacity,is becoming one of the decisive factors. This study aims to use empirical analysis to identify the relationships between organizational culture,absorptive capacity,and performance of international logistics service providers (ILSP) in Korea. The empirical research shows that (1) there is no direct relationship between the construct of power distance and performance; (2) absorptive capacity has no mediation effect on the relationship between the construct of uncertainty avoidance and business performance; (3) in the case of the constructs of masculinity and femininity and individualism and collectivism,there is a full mediation effect only on financial performance; (4) there is partial mediation between long-term orientation and non-financial performance. Overall,the results of this study suggest that managers of ILSP should bear in mind that the constructs of organizational culture have considerable influence over an organization’s absorptive capacity and business performance.

It is currently unclear however how firms are able to source external knowledge from external actors when attempting to innovate. In this paper we examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and firms' ability to enter into innovation cooperation with external actors. Our econometric results show that internal R&D, training and an educated workforce, as core aspects of firms' absorptive capacity, are positively associated with (the intensity of) innovation cooperation. An implication is that external knowledge does not enter the firm freely. The costs firms must invoke in order to be able to source external knowledge in the OI context is considerable. Without investing in internal R&D, training and recruiting workers with good educational qualifications, firms may not be able to follow the open approach to innovation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Whereas on the general level, collaborative innovation has been studied widely, and firm-specific success factors in collaboration between competitors (i.e., coopetition) have not been exhaustively addressed. Earlier literature describes coopetition as a risky but potentially rewarding relationship in which sharing, learning, and protection of knowledge are recognized as the key issues determining the possible benefits and hazards. This study provides evidence of factors related to this, suggesting that the firm's ability to acquire knowledge from external sources (potential absorptive capacity) and to protect its innovations and core knowledge against imitation (appropriability regime) are relevant in increasing the innovation outcomes of collaborating with its competitors. This study also distinguishes between incremental and radical innovations as an outcome of coopetition, and provides differing implications for the two innovation types. The empirical evidence for the study was gathered from a cross-industry survey conducted on Finnish markets. The data are analyzed with multivariate multiple regression analysis. The results of the analysis suggest that (1) potential absorptive capacity and appropriability regime of the firm both have a positive effect in the pursuit of incremental innovations in coopetition, and (2) in the case of radical innovations, appropriability regime has a positive effect, while the effect of absorptive capacity is not statistically significant. However, the results also indicate that there is a moderating relationship between these variables, in that the potential absorptive capacity is positively associated with creation of radical innovations within high levels of appropriability regime. These results yield important theoretical and managerial implications. As a whole, the results presented in this study provide new evidence on which types of firms can reap success in the challenging task of collaborative innovation with rivals. In the case of incremental innovation, a firm-level emphasis on knowledge sharing and learning will positively affect the results of coopetition, as will an emphasis on knowledge protection. Thus, when incremental developments are pursued in coopetition, firms should not only seek to exchange knowledge to create value but also remember to secure the firm-specific core knowledge within the firm's borders to stay competitive. On the other hand, when the firm is pursuing radical innovation with its rivals, the heaviest emphasis should be on protecting its existing core knowledge and also emerging novel innovations and market opportunities. Capabilities in knowledge acquisition are also beneficial in these cases, but the full benefits of knowledge exchange realize only when the firm's knowledge protection mechanisms are sufficiently strong, allowing for safe knowledge exchange between rivals. © 2012 Product Development & Management Association."

(2009)]. For over a decade, several strategies to improve the use of knowledge by policy-makers have been promoted [Landry et al. (2006); Amara et al. (2004)]. Among them, the use of individuals called «intermediaries» or «knowledge brokers» is presented as a potential strategy [Hargadon (2002); Lomas (2007)]. Situated at the organizational interface, these actors benefit from a strategic position allowing easier access to external knowledge [Cohen and Levinthal (1990)]. Therefore, they must develop good skills to be able to properly enjoy all opportunities to create value for their organization. In fact, many authors consider brokers as true knowledge integrators that assess, interpret, synthesize, exploit and transfer pertinent knowledge. Despite the presence of several studies that stress the importance of the multifaceted role of brokers, few have explored how these actors concretely integrate or absorb knowledge and especially, what skills are necessary for the success of their activities. The aims of this paper are: to propose a new conceptual model on research integration by knowledge brokers and to provide an empirical testing of this proposed model. The conceptual framework to be presented in this study builds on recent theoretical developments on the concept of knowledge absorptive capacity [Todorova and Durisin (2007)]. To test the conceptual framework, we collected survey data. The sample of 297 respondents was composed of professionals and managers involved at different levels of health services in Canada. To be eligible, respondents had to be engaged in knowledge brokering activities. Data analysis allowed presenting a first portrait of the profile of knowledge brokers working in health organizations in Canada. In this perspective, several descriptive analyses, such as the distribution of knowledge brokers according to their membership organizations, their status, education, experience, etc., were completed. Other confirmatory analyses with EQS were completed to confirm the theoretical validity of the dimensions of the broker's absorptive capacity. Finally, bivariate analyses were used with these dimensions to compare knowledge brokers regarding their absorptive capacity and the explanatory variables documented in the literature. In the last part of this paper, we discuss the implications of the results on the role of knowledge brokers regarding the use of evidence in health organizations and public policy. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company."
"Innovation in clusters: Effects of absorptive capacity and environmental moderators","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928615584&doi=10.1108%2f10595421311319807&partnerID=40&md5=525f9740e0c88bb38cbdc06599e3f1be","Purpose – This paper aims to empirically explore the impact of absorptive capacity (AC) on explorative and exploitative innovation in business cluster settings, and the environment’s moderating role on these relationships. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of Central European companies, the paper applies multivariate data analysis techniques to test the effect of AC on innovation performance and potential moderators, respectively. Findings – The empirical evidence indicates that AC impacts both explorative and exploitative innovation, and that the strength of the impact depends on the business clusters’ level of dynamism and competitiveness. Environmental dynamism and competitiveness positively moderate the effect of AC on explorative innovation, and negatively moderate the effect of AC on exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications – Several research limitations apply. First, only one interview per firm was conducted on a self-reporting basis. Second, the survey’s focus was on SMEs. Third, questionnaire translations and differing interviewer behaviour may bias the results. Practical implications – The findings suggest that firms in business clusters must develop AC to gain the fruits of agglomeration effects. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the cluster’s environmental conditions, since dynamism and competition play a significant role for innovation. Originality/value – Although the importance of AC has often been highlighted, much more remains to be understood about its role in business cluster settings. This issue is addressed in this work by providing systematic, empirical evidence on how AC affects innovation performance at the firm level, and on how this relationship depends on the business cluster’s environmental characteristics. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We find that firms with higher absorptive capacity gain significantly more from importing foreign capital. Our results also suggest a threshold for such benefits. Furthermore, the productive contribution of skilled labor is significantly higher in firms that import foreign capital. Developing policies to augment absorptive capacity will help firms in developing countries to realize benefits associated with imported capital. © 2010 Western Economic Association International."

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs structural equation modeling to test three hypotheses: first, ENs influence an EEF manager's propensity to enter culturally/psychically distant markets for exports. Distant markets are more likely to be chosen by managers of firms with abundant ENs. Second, AC moderates this network-market location relationship. Third, superior performance results from the fit between managers' propensity to enter a market and firms' levels of ENs and AC. Findings: An analysis of 196 Chinese exporting firms supports the hypotheses. Research limitations/implications: Though the theoretical discussion is general, the empirical context is specific to Chinese export manufacturers. Replicating the study is necessary in different contexts. Practical implications: The study identifies to managers the importance of external (i.e. ENs) and internal resources and capabilities (i.e. AC) and linkages between resources and capabilities, strategy and performance. Originality/value: The study is novel in conceptually addressing the role of ENs and AC in firms' decision making and performance and in testing hypotheses with robust methodology and data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, it takes time before the implementation of EMS can efficiently and effectively affect economic performance from learning effects. Surprisingly, the study employing the absorptive capacity to examine the impacts of learning effects of EMS on the performance of firms has never been discussed before. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze impacts of learning effects of EMS on the performance of firms from the perspectives of organizational institutions and working attitudes. In order to solve the problem, a conceptual model to analyze the tension between product strategies and strategy implementation is proposed. After practical investigation, the paper finds characteristics of different learning effects of EMS, their impacts on the performance of firms and their suitable corresponding management controls. This will provide several contributions to industry practice and policy, not only for managers but also for policy makers in selecting the appropriate policy mix. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This research highlights the importance of contextual factors on learning through international strategic alliances. Based on an empirical study of 271 alliances, our findings reveal that successful alliance learning not only depends on the partner's openness to share knowledge but also relies on the firm's capacity to identify and absorb such knowledge. Institutional differences between the countries from where partner firms originate are considered to hinder the alliance learning by decreasing the firm's absorptive capacity and by enhancing knowledge ambiguity. However, our research suggests that frequent direct communication and high levels of mutual trust and reciprocal commitment between partner firms positively moderate the noxious effects of institutional differences on the alliance learning process.

In this study, we investigate how the technological distance of a TC from the firm will shape the impact of TC participation on the firm's innovation performance. Specifically, we posit that participation in TCs that are central (low technological distance) to the company's existing product technologies and offerings will contribute to its competence-enhancing innovation whereas participation in TCs that are peripheral (high technological distance) to current technologies and offerings will contribute to its new-competence innovation. Given the need to interpret and apply the information internally, we also consider the moderating effects of the firm's absorptive capacity and knowledge integration mechanisms. The study hypotheses are validated by combining survey-based and archival data related to a sample of 168 US-based wireless telecommunication firms.

With the trend of globalisation, fi rms between different countries are now more closely connected with each other, but advanced fi rms still pay much attention to the intellectual property protection and avoid technological spillovers to local fi rms in emerging economies. In such environments, it is critical for local fi rms in emerging economies to enhance their own ACAP and absorb and apply external advanced technological knowledge. Moreover, in different stages of technological catching-up, the pattern of fi rms' innovation strategies should evolve accordingly and similarly, the different dimensions of ACAP are complementary and play different roles in different stages. Based on the Huawei case study, this paper suggests that local fi rms in emerging economies should stress different dimensions of ACAP and enhance them in different developmental stages during the process of transformation from technological imitators to technological leaders.

While the determinants of university-business cooperation have been examined extensively, less attention has been given to the mediating influence of proximity in this relationship. The analysis in this paper builds on the UK business innovation survey (2002-2005) by incorporating measures of the university research environment for each of the 16,500 businesses surveyed. These measures allow us to look beyond business-level characteristics as determinants of the geography of university cooperation and account for the character of the local university environment. Measures include the distance from each business to its nearest university, the quality of local university research and the density of the university research environment. The findings suggest that significant differences exist between those businesses that cooperate with local universities and those that cooperate with non-local universities. These differences relate to business size, sales profile, location, absorptive capacity and innovation activity. In addition, we also find that if a business is located close to a research excellent university, cooperation tends to remain local, however, the distance between businesses and the nearest university is not a significant determinant of university-business cooperation and further, the higher the concentration of universities in the business locale, the more likely businesses are to cooperate with non-local universities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The conclusion suggests that the effectiveness of government technology transfer programs can be improved if a dual approach is adopted. For transfers to lesser developed countries, the initial step should be to understand the differences in paradigms, and this should be followed by the development of appropriate technologies that enhance the development potential of the recipient in terms of the recipients’ values and worldviews. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Building on transaction costs theory and the relational view of alliances, we analyse the effectiveness of these investments in R&D outsourcing agreements from the viewpoint of the client. We argue that, when outsourcing to business firms, the safeguards adopted by the clients to prevent spillovers may reduce the effectiveness of the supplier's specialized investments. Using original survey data from 170 European and US technology-intensive firms, we find that the contribution of these investments to client performance decreases the more a client's core knowledge is required to perform the service, except when outsourcing to non-profits. This suggests that as the appropriability hazards associated with outsourcing to business firms rise, the client is able to capture less value from the supplier's relationship-specific investments. © 2012 The Authors.

This research is a step toward filling this void. Tobit regression analysis on secondary data was performed using various types of external partners as sources of innovation to determine the innovation performance of transportation and logistics service firms. The results show that customers, suppliers, and competitors (in descending order) contribute to service improvement, and customers contribute to the development of services that are new to the firm.

We combine arguments from entrepreneurship theory and the theory of recombinative innovation to construct an overarching theoretical framework that argues why resource constraints can promote, rather than impede, radical innovation. We then build hypotheses on two specific resource constraints, knowledge and financial, and test these by a lagged-variable random-effects Tobit model with longitudinal data from an exceptionally large and detailed innovation survey. Controlling for absorptive capacity, firm age, and firm growth, we find full support for the hypothesis that knowledge constraints spur radical innovation and partial support for the hypothesis that financial constraints spur radical innovation.

"The collaboration of innovation intermediaries and manufacturing firms in the markets for technology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893865445&doi=10.1111%2fjpim.12068&partnerID=40&md5=8d0a58f95fcf54eaaabc1057fcff1821","Many manufacturing firms have opened up their product innovation processes and actively transfer knowledge with external partners in the markets for technology. However, the markets for technological knowledge have remained inefficient in comparison with the markets for most products. To reduce some of the market inefficiencies, manufacturing firms may collaborate with innovation intermediaries, which are defined as organizations that act as agents or brokers in the innovation process between two or more parties. These innovation intermediaries comprise different service providers ranging from consulting companies to Internet marketplaces for technology. In light of an increasing importance of intermediary services in the context of open innovation, this paper specifically focuses on the collaboration of manufacturing firms and innovation intermediaries, which may be critical for the success of intermediary services. Based on new interview data from 30 innovation intermediaries and 30 European manufacturing firms, this paper examines the question of how innovation intermediaries and manufacturing firms collaborate concerning the following issues, which emerged as the key themes from the interviews: potential of intermediation, roles of intermediaries, types of intermediation, drivers of intermediation, complementarity of intermediation, compensation of intermediation, and the importance of repeated collaborations. The findings indicate how manufacturing firms may reduce their transaction costs in technology markets by collaborating with intermediaries. However, intermediary services can only be regarded as a complement rather than a substitute of manufacturing firms' internal activities of managing technology transfer. Thus, manufacturing firms need sufficient internal capabilities for managing technology transfer, such as absorptive capacity and desorptive capacity. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association."
"The passion for knowledge: Implications for its transfer","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874087209&doi=10.1002%2fkpm.1402&partnerID=40&md5=ad860f3cda18ecb7149e34807a676d3d","Research into knowledge sharing has mainly treated knowledge from an instrumental, market-driven perspective. On this view, research has focused on the psychological (e.g. motivation), cognitive (e.g. absorptive capacity) and social features (e.g. weak/strong ties) of the knowledge entities, the structural (formal or informal) characteristics of the organizational context and the nature of knowledge to be transferred (such as its stickiness and causal complexity). The present study seeks to suggest passion as a contingency that impacts the knowledge transfer process positively. Passion for knowledge may constitute a social bond that holds a community together. Passionate members are inclined to share their object of passion-knowledge-more readily. Our argument is based on information elicited from a number of scientific experts within the petrol industry. In their daily work, experts regard the transfer of knowledge as sine qua non of becoming expert, as interactions with others are (i) learning opportunities for themselves and (ii) as social occasions to relate to their peers and on to talk about and share stories about the object to their passion (knowledge). The contribution of the paper is thus to suggest emotional aspects (passion, attachment and interest) related to knowledge as a factor that impacts the transfer of knowledge. Finally, conclusions and implications are discussed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Existing studies mainly assume licensed technologies are homogeneously accessible to firms, and a prevailing explanation as to why firms vary in their innovation performance lies in differences of absorptive capacity. In this study, we intend to relax this assumption and use data about 186 Chinese indigenous firms to investigate how differences in in-licensing portfolios lead to different effects on innovation performance. We find that firms benefit from prior in-licensing technologies and the result is related to four dimensions of their licensing portfolios. We find that 1) the scale of firms' technology in-licensing has an inverted-U relationship with their subsequent innovation performance; 2) firms that license-in foreign technologies tend to outperform those that predominantly license-in technologies from domestic sources; 3) the newness of firms' technology in-licensing yields a positive effect on subsequent innovation performance; and 4) a diverse portfolio of licensors from whom technologies are licensed-in has an inverted-U relationship with firms' subsequent technological diversity. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

Focusing on the concept of social brokerage, the findings show that bridging structural holes and connecting pairs of other actors are conducive to a firm's absorptive capacity and innovation performance. Overall, this study suggests that the locus of innovation lies in the structure of a firm's external collaboration network as well as internal capabilities to exploit the network externalities. © eContent Management Pty Ltd."

Opening up the innovation process and letting knowledge percolate through the boundaries of the firm is however not a guarantee to success. Many small and medium sized firms simply have insufficient resources to collaborate on innovation and lack in-house absorptive capacity to capture the results thereof. In Belgium the collective research centres have specialised in various activities related to R&D collaboration and technology transfer. As such they act as technology intermediaries. This paper positions these particular players in the innovation system. Further, it provides an insight into how collective research centres help firms, many of which are low tech SMEs, to build absorptive capacity for R&D activities. In this way, this paper aims at filling a gap in the literature, which has mainly focused on technology transfer in high tech sectors, technology transfer from universities to companies and government initiatives that stimulate tech transfer. We find that collective research centres are unique actors in the innovation system, engaging in both R&D and technology transfer activities to an extent that depends on their size, R&D budgets and number of members and aiming at strengthening the members' absorptive capacity. © eContent Management Pty Ltd."

Portuguese and German data from the harmonised Community Innovation Survey III (CIS) allow us to compare innovation cooperation behaviour of private firms in the two countries. We first look at differences between the drivers of foreign and domestic cooperation and find, that absorptive capacities influence both types of cooperation. Supporting absorptive capacity building can therefore be a policy tool to foster international and domestic R&D cooperation at the same time. We also show that the characteristics of firms cooperating with foreigners in both countries are quite similar. International activities other than cooperation, firm size and the importance of protection methods for knowledge have a positive influence on the decision to cooperate with foreign partners in both countries. Some differences remain, however In Germany, exporters are more likely to cooperate with foreign partners than non-exporters, whereas in Portugal this is not the case. © eContent Management Pty Ltd."

AC in incremental innovation can be described as 'epistemic absorptive capacity' (EAC), based on a stable set of design rules to address pre-identified problems; AC in radical innovation, which we label 'conceptual absorptive capacity' (CAC), is based on 'refined visions' with three facets: 1 'rule-breaking', to move from known to out-of-the-box 2 'hook building', to overcome cognitive crises by linking the unknown to multiple cognitive references 3 'milieu stimulation', to support the creation of new knowledge in the milieu.

It places the organizational capabilities of absorptive capacity and combinative capability in the context of M&As. Absorptive capacity - i.e., the combining firms' ability to explore new knowledge - relies on the extent of prior related experiences of acquirers and their acquired firms, and available complementary knowledge among the two. Combinative capability - i.e., the combining firms' ability to combine and recombine available existing knowledge - depends on the opportunity, motivation, and ability to share knowledge. The chapter concludes with several contextual factors that intensify the roles of knowledge, and reveal important contradictory roles in the development and value of absorptive capacity and combinative capability.

In this paper we investigate, on the basis of exemplary case studies, the entire process with regard to how firms recognise new knowledge and how it is captured and incorporated. Our findings show that knowledge absorption is based on routines which govern knowledge selection and integration into the existing knowledge structure. Knowledge complexity shapes the routine's characteristics. The absorption of complex knowledge requires more interaction and connectedness between knowledge provider and receiver for developing a similar frame of reference that serves as a carrier of newly absorbed knowledge. Finally, firms need to deal with the paradox that simple routines enhance recognition of new knowledge while a complex set of routines facilitate its incorporation in the subsequent stages.

In Europe small and medium enterprises still prevail, business districts are widespread and rivals are called to cooperate, in order to face the global context. Inter-firm collaboration seems to be the main path to survive and compete. Literature has more concentrated on the reasons for success of strategic alliances and networks even if many of them fail or do not take off. In the light of relational view and the absorptive capacity approach, the paper tries to verify whether coopetiton, can be, through the relations that generates, source of competitive advantage or rather of disadvantage. Theoretical hints are tested empirically on a sample of firms in Italy operating in tourism industry."

Creative products represent the production of viable, original solutions to problems that call for, or permit, creativity. When creativity is viewed as a product, albeit an intellectual one, arising in response to certain types of problems, the key methodological concern in studies of creativity becomes apparent. Of these characteristics of creative problems, the concept of ill definition has, perhaps, received the most attention. For ill-defined problems, no one solution will suffice. Rather multiple different, albeit potentially viable, solutions may be generated. In fact, recognition of this point led to the development of divergent thinking tests. Ill-definition, however, is not simply a matter of multiple potential, equally viable, solutions being possible. Ill-defined problems allow the problem to be construed, or understood, in different ways. Thus, an organizational purchase problem may be understood in terms of enhancing financial viability, increasing absorptive capacity, or amortizing risks. These alternative ways of framing, or approaching, the problem allow for the generation of multiple potential responses. Similarly, exactly what constitutes a viable solution may not be apparent. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

These relations were tested on the basis of struc-tural equation modeling using 444 questionnaires completed by large-scale pig farmers in the Netherlands. Previous studies on the relation between network structure and innovativeness re-tained the absorptive capacity 'black box' by using proxies for absorption of knowledge. The pre-sent study addresses this shortcoming by studying absorptive capacity in terms of organizational capacities (routines and processes) of farmers to use their networks and absorb external knowledge. The findings show that frequency of contact in a specific network range affects in-novativeness positively, but also indirectly through acquisition and assimilation capacity. Assim-ilation capacity turns out to be the most important dimension of absorptive capacity for the inno-vativeness of pig farmers. © 2012 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA)."

A very adept vehicle to achieve this is strategic alliances. Extensive conceptual work has been done on cross-border knowledge transfer, but insufficient empirical work. This research study sets out to use an empirical case study of the Foskor-Coromandel cross-border collaboration to investigate the knowledge transfer. The strategic alliance is a buyer-supplier type of inter-firm alliance. The study uses a conceptual model derived from literature to discuss the influence of factors (knowledge characteristics, knowledge recipient characteristics, knowledge supplier characteristics and relationship characteristics) on the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer. The study also examines the impact of effective knowledge transfer on firm performance. The study findings indicated that of the factors considered knowledge complexity, absorptive capacity, recipient collaborativeness, transfer capacity and organisational distance had the most significant impact on the knowledge transfer and its effectiveness. Firm performance is positively impacted by effective knowledge transfer, leading to the conclusion that inter-firm strategic alliances as a vehicle to transfer knowledge can be an effective source of competitive advantage. © 2012 IEEE."

Most previous research examines customer satisfaction with MFS. However, this research does not explain why MFS is expanding relatively more slowly than Internet financial services in general. Therefore, this study investigates this issue by determining the key drivers of MFS usage intention. Specifically, the research model includes five exogenous variables: task-fit, monetary value, connectivity, personal innovativeness, and absorptive capacity. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use both serve as mediators between the first four of these five factors and usage intention. Connectivity influences perceived ease-of-use directly. In addition, perceived monetary value has a significant effect on perceived usefulness, inferring MFS is not only useful for a firm, but also is useful from a time and monetary value standpoint. Personal innovativeness significantly influences perceived ease-of-use, so innovative users can take advantage of MFS more frequently. Absorptive capacity also directly affects usage intention. Finally, perceived task technology, versus a task characteristic view, significantly influences perceived usefulness. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.."

We explore the dynamics of balance of innovation output regarding resulting from dichotomized strategic decisions in exploration and exploitation under the variable rate of external technological knowledge usage. We build a system dynamic model considering the process of absorptive capacity at the company level and additionally facilitate feedback loops in the process. We shed light on the dynamics of innovation creation from external technological knowledge acquisition when small initial changes in strategic decision making lead to substantial differences in company output.

I present a formal model in which an inventor and the existing firm engage in a strategic innovation game by choosing whether to compete or to cooperate through technology transfer. The model highlights how the problem of tacit knowledge affects the inventor's R&D investment and the existing firm's investment in absorptive capacity. The inventor's tacit knowledge implies that benefits from own-use through entrepreneurship can exceed the benefits from technology transfer. In equilibrium, higher-quality inventions result in entrepreneurship and lower-quality inventions result in technology transfer. R&D investment and absorption investment are strategic substitutes in the innovation game with the option of entrepreneurship. The possibility of entrepreneurship increases R&D investment and reduces absorption investment. The equilibrium probability of entrepreneurship is decreasing in the costs of R&D, increasing in the costs of absorption, and decreasing in the set-up costs of new firms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

This number of non-adopters is higher in sectors that are not normally selling online and thus challenging such adoption. Interestingly, there are some firms in those challenging sectors that have used online selling innovatively and succeeded in their adoption. While the literature addressed external business factors as an explanation for the adoption of online selling, it lacked in addressing the internal organizational factors that influence such adoption in sectors with lower adoption rates. Thus, the objective of this research is to identify and understand the internal organizational capabilities that helped those firms to adopt online selling and take advantage of the associated opportunities. This research is based on Wheeler's [1] Net Enabled Business Innovation Cycle (NEBIC) theoretical framework which utilizes both dynamic capability and absorptive capacity theories.

Recent research on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-corporate financial performance (CFP) relationship proposes a variety of contextual and organizational factors to create a more robust link. However, few of these studies explore the role of the CSR engagement strategy. Drawing on absorptive capacity theory and related perspectives such as time compression diseconomies, asset mass efficiencies, and path dependence theory, we argue that when a firm engages in CSR slowly and consistently, focuses on related CSR dimensions, and starts with internal dimensions of CSR, CFP will be enhanced. With longitudinal data collected from 130 firms from 1995 to 2007, we find that firms benefit more when they adopt a CSR engagement strategy that is consistent, involves related dimensions of CSR, and begins with aspects of CSR that are more internal to the firm. The pace of the CSR engagement strategy, however, does not moderate the CSR-CFP relationship. This study helps fill the gap in CSR research by showing that, regardless of contextual factors, a firm can choose the proper strategy to enhance the financial benefits of the CSR engagement. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies."

The reciprocal outbound activities range from transferring of knowledge and ideas to solutions delivered to other firms' new product development projects. This paper names the firms that produce the reciprocal outbound activity for ""providers,"" and is the first to empirically investigate such providers of ideas, solutions, and technologies for other firms' open innovation activities. The literature review shows a surprising shortage of research on who the providers are, how they engage with other firms, and not least what potential benefits can be achieved from supporting other firms' innovation activities. The paper uses a quantitative survey on Danish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) carried out in 2010 to identify the providers, the role they take on, and the main benefits the providers gain. This paper finds that firms that are providers are indeed an under-researched and important phenomenon for firms' innovation activities. Compared to receivers of knowledge, the providers are younger, have a higher R&D intensity, adopt more open innovation practices, have higher absorptive capacity, and fewer barriers toward knowledge sharing as demonstrated by the NIH and NSH syndromes. Finally, although only tentatively, the paper finds that the provider firms are more product innovative compared to nonproviders. The paper further finds that more projects, more embedded relationships, and mutual rather than one-way exchange relationships significantly raise the probability that a firm experiences a substantial benefit from providing to other firms' new product development projects. The overall ambition of the paper at this point is to inspire other researchers to pursue the agenda on the provider perspective for future research. To support such research, the paper suggests a broadening of the research perspectives from the receiver of knowledge, in the literature on interorganizational relationships and open innovation, to include the provider, and even suggests some preliminary ideas for such research. Hence, the contribution of this paper lies not only in opening a new research topic but also in identifying some first characteristics of the phenomenon adding a substantial perspective to the literature on open innovation and interorganizational relationships.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on an exploratory qualitative interview study among German SMEs of the metal and mechanical engineering industry that have participated in ""Ecoprofit"", an intermediary based program that aims at introducing organizations to the concept of sustainable development through implementation of eco-innovations. Findings: The key findings are that first, the proactive approach by a public intermediary (here local authority) is one essential push factor to trigger eco-innovations in SMEs with low absorptive capacity. Second, it is found that SMEs may need facilitation for eco-innovation from different types of intermediaries (public and private) with different levels of support, which can range from customized and individual to more loosely held support, such as networks.

The case studies were all undertaken in SMEs in a developing country since this is an important but under researched area for the application of the concept of absorptive capacity. A particular implication of the findings is that firms lacking knowledge of IT implementation cannot simply seek this from external sources but must develop internal organizational knowledge processes if their implementations of IT systems are to be effective. This finding is particularly pertinent to the developing country and SME context of this study, where low levels of experience within the firm and the loss of experienced staff are found to impact on the development of absorptive capacity.

The conclusions of the model follow directly from the functional forms that are used to describe the generation and absorption of technological knowledge. The first proposition formally characterizes the steady-state rate of growth of technology for the model. The analysis also shows how some of the key features of two distinct, pure modes of organization of the production of new knowledge, the R&D model and the new localized knowledge model, are implied by our model by simply drastically changing the relative magnitude of two exogenous parameters: the ease of learning and the pace of knowledge advance. The second proposition formally characterizes the connections implied by the model between involuntary spillovers and absorptive capacity. Analysis of the long-term interactions between involuntary spillovers of knowledge and absorptive capacity provides the essential insights into an understanding of the elements of a self-sustained process of endogenous growth.

Using longitudinal patent cross-citation data, we find an inverted U-shaped pattern over time that is influenced by firm-level and relational factors. Technological similarity only modestly increases learning in the initial stages of a relationship, but moderate levels substantially increase knowledge flows later in the alliance. High technological diversity is related to higher initial learning rates, but the effects diminish over time. Somewhat surprisingly, research and development intensity is negatively related to initial learning rates but has a considerable positive effect later in the relationship. We suggest that initial learning rates in alliances may be constrained by the capacity to absorb knowledge, while later-stage outcomes are constrained by exploitation capacity.

The authors also seek to examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and the existence and enhancement of innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 54 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 hospital-in-the-home units (HHU) in Spain. Findings: The results show that absorptive capacity is an important dynamic determinant for developing a HHU's innovativeness. Moreover, this relationship is best explained with two related constructs. Firstly, the HHU's unlearning context plays a key role in managing the tension between potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Secondly, the results also shed light on a tangible means for health managers to enhance their units' innovativeness (quality of service) through IS capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design does not allow observation of the short- and long-term impact of absorptive capacity on the unlearning context, information systems capability and HHU's innovativeness. Although the model presented here proposes sequenced relationships between absorptive capacities (PACAP and RACAP), the unlearning context and IS capability, the authors measure all these constructs at one point in time. Practical implications: This sequential model presented in this paper provides practical steps for managers interested in organizational structures that support organizational innovativeness.

These interactions basically represent traded (market-based) transactions, which constitute important sources of knowledge in clusters. The paper addresses the role of TCs in low-tech clusters, and uses semi-structured interviews with 80 firms in a manufacturing cluster. The results point out that producer-user interactions are the most frequent; thus, the higher the sector knowledge-intensive base, the more likely the utilization of the available research infrastructure becomes. Conversely, the sectors with less knowledge-intensive structures, i.e. less absorptive capacity (AC), present weak linkages to TCs, as they frequently prefer to interact with suppliers, who act as transceivers of knowledge. Therefore, not all the firms in a cluster can fully exploit the available research infrastructure, and their AC moderates this engagement. In addition, the existence of TCs is not sufficient since the active role of a firm's search strategies to undertake interactions and conduct openness to available sources of knowledge is also needed.

"Enriching Absorptive Capacity through Social Interaction","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864913824&doi=10.1111%2fj.1467-8551.2011.00749.x&partnerID=40&md5=53b3391455d0aecb2ba3bcd816ec26e7","Absorptive capacity is frequently highlighted as a key determinant of knowledge transfer within multinational enterprises. But how individual behaviour translates into absorptive capacity at the subsidiary level, and how this is contingent on subsidiaries' social context, remains under-addressed. This not only limits our understanding of the relationship between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity, but also hampers further research on potentially relevant managerial and organizational antecedents, and limits the implications we can draw for practitioners who seek to increase their organization's capacity to put new knowledge to use. To address this shortcoming we conduct an in-depth comparative case study of a headquarters-initiated knowledge transfer at two subsidiaries of the same multinational enterprise. The findings demonstrate that social interaction is a prerequisite for subsidiary absorptive capacity as it enables employees to participate in the transformation of new knowledge to the local context and the development of local applications. The findings also illustrate how organizational conditions at the subsidiary level can impact subsidiary absorptive capacity by enabling or constraining local interaction patterns. These insights contribute to the absorptive capacity literature by demonstrating the scale and scope of social interaction as a key link between individual- and organizational-level absorptive capacity. © 2011 The Author(s).

"The effects of CEOs' social networks on organizational performance through knowledge and strategic flexibility","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866681600&doi=10.1108%2f00483481211263719&partnerID=40&md5=32830387eeed46fee028147e2aba3448","Purpose: This study seeks to analyze theoretically and empirically how different intermediate strategic variables related to knowledge (combinative capabilities and absorptive capacity) and strategic flexibility influence the relation between CEOs' social networks and organizational performance. To date, very little research has analyzed the direct and indirect relationships between these variables. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature, a theoretical model is developed that shows the interrelations between these variables. The methodology used was LISREL analysis. The model is then tested using data from 203 Spanish organizations. Findings: This investigation shows the influence of CEOs' social networks (larger networks with strong ties) and capabilities (combinative capabilities and absorptive capacity) on the level of strategic flexibility. It then shows the influence of their strategic flexibility level on organizational performance. It adds theoretical and empirical arguments to the importance of CEOs' social networks for the organization. Originality/value: Today's information and knowledge society requires new CEOs who can confront a reality based on knowledge and foster strategic flexibility to achieve improvements in organizational performance. However, organizations sometimes fail to achieve sustainable competitive advantage due to their limited understanding of the relationships between these strategic variables. This paper develops a complete framework of the capturing of knowledge and information from outside the organization performed by CEOs and the process they use to assimilate, transform and use this knowledge in the organization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."
"A knowledge-based model of radical innovation in small software firms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866018291&partnerID=40&md5=65f6a926cf2cc3768c3dce81aee02c9a","In this paper, we adopt the lens of absorptive capacity (ACAP), defined by two dimensions-the knowledge base (consisting of knowledge diversity, depth, and linkages) and routines (consisting of sensing and experimentation)-to explain how a software firm's knowledge endowments influence its level of radical information technology innovation during a technological breakthrough. We distinguish three types of IT innovations-base, processes, and service innovation-that form an innovation ecology. We posit that (I) ACAP is a relational construct where the impact of the knowledge base is mediated by routines; (2) IT innovations are either externally adopted or internally generated; and (3) knowledge antecedents associated with different types of innovations differ. We hypothesize a three-step, mediated path (knowledge base -→ sensing -→ experimentation → innovation) for external innovation adoption, and a two-step path (knowledge diversity/depth → experimentation → innovation) for internal innovation creation to explain the software firm's level of radical innovation across three IT innovation types. We validate the model through a cross-sector study that examined how 121 small software firms innovated with Internet computing. We confirm the mediated nature of ACAP for external base innovations, which are driven by all three knowledge-based factors as follows: (1) knowledge depth (direct positive effect); (2) knowledge diversity (mediated three-step path), (3) knowledge linkages (mediated three step path). Process innovations are externally driven by a three-step mediated path for knowledge linkages, as well as being directly affected by knowledge diversity, but negatively and directly impeded by knowledge depth. Service innovations are not driven by any mediated influence of ACAP, but driven directly by knowledge diversity. At the same time, both service and process innovations are strongly influenced by prior IT innovations: base and/or service. Several directions for future studies of radical IT innovation are proposed."

The authors test a theoretical model exploring how inter-firm knowledge transfer is enabled or hindered by a buyer's learning intent, the degree of supplier protectiveness, inter-firm knowledge ambiguity, and absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 153 R&D intensive manufacturing firms in the UK automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, electrical, chemical, and general manufacturing industries was used to test the framework. To analyse the data, two-step structural equation modeling in AMOS 7.0 was used. Findings: The results indicate that a buyer's learning intent increases inter-firm knowledge transfer, but also acts as an incentive for suppliers to protect their knowledge. Such defensive measures increase the degree of inter-firm knowledge ambiguity, encouraging buyer firms to invest in absorptive capacity as a means to interpret supplier knowledge, but also increase the degree of knowledge transfer. Practical implications: The paper illustrates the effects of focusing on acquisition, rather than accessing supplier technological knowledge. The paper shows that an overt learning strategy can be detrimental to knowledge transfer between buyer-supplier, as suppliers react by restricting the flow of information. Organisations are encouraged to consider this dynamic when engaging in multi-organisational, NPD projects. Originality/value: The paper examines the dynamics of knowledge transfer within inter-firm NPD projects, showing how transfer is influenced by the buyer firm's learning intention, supplier's response, characteristics of the relationship and knowledge to be transferred. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

It is of central managerial interest to identify factors facilitating the integration of new inventive staff and thereby counteracting innovation declines after M&As. This paper provides empirical evidence into the role of acquiring firms' absorptive capacity for the post-merger patent productivity of the acquired inventors. Based on a sample of 544 inventors employed by European acquisition targets in the period 2000-2001 it is shown that the post-merger productivity of acquired inventors is significantly higher within acquiring firms with a distinct absorptive capacity. It can be concluded that absorptive capacity is a firm capability that enhances the integration of inventors after firm takeovers. © 2010 The Author(s)."

Design/methodology/approach: Building on previous studies, the study constructs and tests a research model using structural equation modeling and multiple regression analysis for data collected from 271 early internationalizing SMEs. To secure results of hypothesis testing, non-response bias was assessed using a t-test, and tests for data screening and common method bias were conducted. Findings: The results indicate that, for early internationalizing small firms, the prior international business experience of managers and networks affect building knowledge competencies. In the relationship between the use of networks and knowledge competencies, in particular, absorptive capacity is found to play a moderating role. It also finds that international business performance is driven by knowledge competencies the small firms accumulate. The findings imply that firms shortly after inception should raise their ability to acquire and utilize external resources and knowledge to secure international performance. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution to the body of literature on rapid internationalization of small firms by examining the moderating effects of absorptive capacity on the relationship between founding teams' prior international business experience and firms' networks and knowledge competencies. The present study thus helps move forward our understanding on drivers of knowledge competency building and performance of the early internationalizing firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Specifically, it tests the influence of absorptive capacity, inter-firm specific relationships and international exposure on survival. Its key findings are that high absorptive capacity increases survival probabilities; specific customer-supplier relationships enhance survival; and the greater the firm's exposure to internationalization activity, the higher its subsequent chance of survival. Thus, the paper provides evidence that young firms are more likely to survive when they pursue an internationalization strategy based on resource consolidation. © The Author(s) 2010."

The local operating conditions particular to that country are influenced by three analytic dimensions: the source's ability to transfer knowledge, the climate of cooperation between source and recipient and the recipient's absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: The case study deals with four MNCs with subsidiaries in Mozambique which have developed activities in the industrial sector. The analysis is applied to those companies in order to answer the research questions. Findings: The results obtained reveal that the recipient should not be made to feel that the transferred knowledge is imposed by the source, so that it can be used as an asset in the production of new products, but without reproducing the business model of the source. This process of adaptation to the specific local context is crucial. Research limitations/implications: The case study method does not permit the generalization of the results, but it does make it possible to study a combination of problems related to the phenomenon that contribute to a better understanding. Originality/value: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the process of knowledge transfer to subsidiary companies based in Mozambique, and greater efficiency in that process, taking into consideration the specific characteristics of the local market and the local absorptive capacity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Then, using a sample of 224 surveys representative of a cross-section of medium to large firms involved in collaborative ventures, the theoretical model is empirically examined. The results show that collaborative creativity, learning and knowledge stock are critical core inputs of collaborative innovation, with the support of formal coordination mechanisms and internal search processes, such as structural centralisation, formality and absorptive capacity. © 2012 Imperial College Press."

As the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) by MNEs is rapidly growing, empirical studies dealing with knowledge acquisition from parent firms in subsidiaries are in the limelight. However, as far as we know, none has attempted to identify primary mechanisms influencing subsidiary learning by dividing WOSs based on 'investment mode' and 'investment direction'. We believe WOSs are characterized by these two issues and thus this research contributes to current literature by providing a detailed picture of learning mechanisms in subsidiaries. We advance a series of propositions to achieve the research objective by using a sample of WOSs established by MNEs in Korea. By doing this, we reveal that subsidiary learning depends significantly on absorptive capacity in learning organizations, relational capital and parent firms' behavior. Also, we confirm that factors facilitating knowledge acquisition are influenced by investment mode and investment direction. Based on the results, this study provides some useful implications for MNEs and policy makers in local markets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

In this study, we assess the impact of openness on innovation in products/services, and also on process innovation drawing on a large-scale sample of Australian firms. In essence, we find that open innovation models are useful for firms seeking to innovate in processes as well as products and services. However, we find that openness to external information sources may, after a time, lead to decreasing marginal returns as measured by innovation performance. We also observe that, within our sample, the proposed complementarities between internal and external are generally only evident as precursors to the introduction of new products and services, and may not be as beneficial in stimulating process innovations. It is also shown by our study that investment in absorptive capacity has a declining margining effect on the innovation performance of new processes, but not on the introduction of new products and services. © 2012 Imperial College Press."

Disruptive innovation has been a critical strategy to achieve indigenous technological innovations and catching-up in developing countries. The central tenet of our argument is that how well a disrupter performs is contingent upon the extent to which it is embedded in an inter-firm knowledge network. This present study try to unravel three dimensions of knowledge network embeddedness in order to understand in what specific ways it contributes to a firm's disruptive innovation performance. We find that the embeddedness of the knowledge networks promotes disruptive innovation performance through absorptive capacity. Specifically, centrality in a knowledge network, trust between knowledge network partners and sharing goal & culture with knowledge network members do promote disruptive innovation performance through recognizing capacity.

Moreover, the pattern of firms' innovation strategies should evolve gradually in different stages of technological catching-up. And different dimensions of ACAP are complementary, and play different roles in different stages. Based on the Huawei case study, this paper suggests that local firms in emerging economies should attach importance to different dimensions of ACAP and enhance them in different developmental stages in the process of transformation from technological imitators to technological leaders. © 2012 IEEE."

The purpose of the paper is to elaborate the concept of ""protective capacity"" especially in relation to absorptive capacity, by presenting a number of propositions. Design/methodology/approach: Literature on mainly interfirm relationships, absorptive capacity and resources-based theory are reviewed and combined. Findings: Protective capacity is defined as the ""capacity to sustain, or to reduce the speed of depreciation of knowledge-based resources by preventing knowledge from being identified, imitated, and/or acquired by direct or indirect competitors"". Owing to the strong moderating factor of organizational openness, it is argued that protective capacity is inversely related to absorptive capacity. A number of propositions that can explain and moderate the inverse relationship between protective capacity and absorptive capacity are elaborated and discussed. These propositions concern organizational openness, knowledge management practices, realized and potential absorptive capacity, and dyadic relationships. Originality/value: Acquiring external knowledge is a key feature of knowledge management. In order for a firm to absorb external knowledge, it is generally argued that it has to be open towards the environment. However, according to resource-based theory, firms have to safeguard their knowledge by, for example, having a secluded organization, thereby enhancing the uncertainty associated with tacit knowledge in order to sustain their competitive advantages. Whereas numerous studies have discussed the capacity to absorb knowledge, few studies have analyzed the capacity to protect knowledge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This study aims to continue this trend in addressing issues related to knowledge transfer and protection through examining roles of absorptive capacity and appropriability regimes and the interplay between them. An appropriability regime can play a dual role when external knowledge and the knowledge-base of the firm form the basis for absorptive capacity, which then contributes to innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides an empirical examination of the direct and moderating roles of appropriability regime regarding the above-mentioned dual role. Data collected from 335 firms was utilized to perform regression analyses. Findings: The empirical evidence suggests, first, that the strength of the appropriability regime has a positive effect on absorptive capacity (especially the acquisition of knowledge) together with good connectedness to external knowledge sources and high levels of internal R&D. In addition, support can be found for the idea of absorptive capacity and the appropriability regime being positively related to innovation performance. Both direct and moderating effects can be found, but they are slightly different for knowledge acquisition and application. Originality/value: This study contributes to prior studies by producing empirical evidence on the relationships described above. An important issue is also that it departs from prior works by viewing an appropriability regime as a factor that can be affected by the firm (i.e. as a strategic tool), and not as a purely environmental or external factor. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In practice, however, results have been mixed. Some homecare services have been successful, but implementation failures are common and the intended patients are frequently reluctant to use the homecare services. A possible explanation for efficiency and effectiveness gaps of services provided by hospital-in-the-home units (HHUs) may relate to the advantages and disadvantages of the knowledge processes that these units highlight as a result of their different structural properties. This study examines the impact of an unlearning (forgetting) context on the HHU's ability to challenge basic beliefs and to implement processes that are explicitly or tacitly helpful in the reception of new ideas (absorptive capacity). These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 54 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 HHUs.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a survey of strategic suppliers from original equipment manufacturers of the automotive industry located in Mexico. Findings: Results suggest that basic and widely used forms of supplier development hardly lead to improved operational and financial performance of suppliers. More demanding and less frequently used forms of supplier development may lead to improved supplier performance given the suppliers have sufficient absorptive capacity and the presence of an adequate collaborative and relational learning context. Research limitations/implications: Only suppliers of firms in the automotive industry were surveyed; participant suppliers were referred by buying firms operating in Mexico. Practical implications: When designing supplier development activities, buying firms need to take into consideration that high involvement and investment on supplier development activities is required when their goal is to improve the supplier base.

As a result, in order to provide the continuous improvement of service quality that will lead to consumer satisfaction, this study explores the impact of external knowledge and knowledge chain on service quality. The results of this study found that absorptive capacity of the external knowledge is indeed an important source of competitive advantage. Hence, enterprises should apply the knowledge chain in order to gather external knowledge from customers, suppliers and competitors, as well as transforming the knowledge to enhance their service quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

In addition, the paper succeeds to partially explains why previous studies show mixed support for the significance of the technology diffusion from foreign affiliates by estimating the innovation capability threshold level. Using data for majority-owned foreign affiliates of the US parent companies in 32 developed and developing countries during the period 1966-2000, the panel data models have two main results. The first result is that the host country innovation capability and export success of local firms have significant impact on the technology transfer spending by foreign affiliates. The second result is that many developing countries do not attain the innovation capability threshold level in order to obtain positive technology spillovers from foreign affiliates. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Knowledge complexity, absorptive capacity and weak ties: An empirical analysis of its effects on franchise systems uniformity","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861890416&doi=10.1108%2f17410381211234417&partnerID=40&md5=fc31df4a1ebaafbaa0efbaa5e4a5d1ae","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of knowledge complexity, absorptive capacity and weak ties between franchisor and franchisee on standards compliance related to quality and operative procedures. Design/methodology/approach: A franchisee outlets survey was carried out to investigate the effect of knowledge, franchisee and relationships characteristics on franchise systems uniformity. A linear regression analysis was conducted on a sample of franchisees from different franchise chains and sectors of activity operating in Spain. The authors also controlled for transformation type, which represents the kind of activities carried out in the franchisee units, whether just commercial or both transformative and commercial activities. Findings: Partial support was found for the hypothesis. Knowledge complexity and absorptive capacity do not affect uniformity, although weak ties do affect it: the fewer weak ties, the greater franchise system uniformity. These results allow the authors to identify differences between outlets that carry out commercial and physical transformation activities and those in which only commercial activities are carried out. Specifically, uniformity is greater in outlets that perform both commercial and productive activities, and lower in outlets that only carry out commercial activities. Originality/value: The paper shows that uniformity can be regarded as a source of competitive advantage in the context of franchise operations with multiple centres dispersed geographically. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Network organizations, such as 'R&D clubs', are one means through which the absorptive capacity and innovation capability of small businesses can be improved. Such clubs can assist member firms with new knowledge exploration and new knowledge exploitation, the key elements of a strategic innovation capability. Five case studies of R&D clubs in Australia are examined with a focus on their approaches to developing the innovation capabilities of their members. The network organizations studied offer a medium to facilitate the development of social capital among their participants, and this increases the diffusion of information, creates higher levels of trust, encourages cooperative behaviour and facilitates learning and innovation. Industry members of each of the clubs have different levels of innovation capability, ranging from 'unaware/passive' to 'strategic' approaches to innovation, and this is reflected in the conditions for collaboration and the types of research project pursued. In building the absorptive capacity and innovation capability of their members, all of the case study clubs adopted 'broadcast' methods to raise awareness, offered 'agent-assisted' mechanisms to help members assimilate and exploit new knowledge, and provided 'peer-assisted' opportunities to learn about innovation and its benefits. The case study findings emphasize the importance of linkages and agents in helping to build the absorptive capacity of network members, and show how social capital underpins 'peer-assisted' capacity-building approaches. While 'e-Collaboration' has more recently been advocated as a key means to improve the performance of smaller firms, we conclude that direct social interaction is necessary to build effective communication, common understandings, resilient trust and the interpersonal relationships that facilitate the sharing of information and organizational learning. © Anabella Davila, Marta M.

Research reporting high failure rates for collaborative alliances with supply chain partners makes formation of global supply chains a high-risk venture. This study examines the influence of strategic enterprise risk management (ERM) processes on improving supply chain capability while mitigating risks. ERM has become a major strategic management focus, and researchers suggest this momentum arises from the need for governance mechanisms that counter the ineffectiveness of government intervention and cooperation in cross-border relationships. We survey 207 organizations on their perceptions of their own ERM processes and a specific supply chain partner's absorptive capacity, B2B e-commerce business risk, and the global business risk associated with that partner relationship. The results support theorized relationships positing that stronger ERM promotes higher levels of partner absorptive capacity, lower B2B risk, and lower associated global business risk. Results further show that associated global business risk is reduced through managing and controlling partner absorptive capacity and B2B risk. Additional analyses show that stronger ERM is associated with partners being from countries with cultural traits conducive to strong supply chain performance."

It is considered an imperative for business success. Modern information technologies perform a critical role in the development and maintenance of a firm's absorptive capacity. We provide an assessment of absorptive capacity in the information systems literature. IS scholars have used the absorptive capacity construct in diverse and often contradictory ways. Confusion surrounds how absorptive capacity should be conceptualized, its appropriate level of analysis, and how it can be measured. Our aim in reviewing this construct is to reduce such confusion by improving our understanding of absorptive capacity and guiding its effective use in IS research. We trace the evolution of the absorptive capacity construct in the broader organizational literature and pay special attention to its conceptualization, assumptions, and relationship to organizational learning. Following this, we investigate how absorptive capacity has been conceptualized, measured, and used in IS research. We also examine how absorptive capacity fits into distinct IS themes and facilitates understanding of various IS phenomena. Based on our analysis, we provide a framework through which IS researchers can more fully leverage the rich aspects of absorptive capacity when investigating the role of information technology in organizations."

We suggest that the literature on Absorptive Capacity does not place sufficient emphasis on distributed knowledge and learning or on the application of innovative knowledge. To accomplish physical transformations, organisations need specific Innovative Capacities that extend beyond knowledge management. Accessive Capacity is the ability to collect, sort and analyse knowledge from both internal and external sources. Adaptive Capacity is needed to ensure that new pieces of equipment are suitable for the organisation's own purposes even though they may have been originally developed for other uses. Integrative Capacity makes it possible for a new or modified piece of equipment to be fitted into an existing production process with a minimum of inessential and expensive adjustment elsewhere in the process. These Innovative Capacities are controlled and coordinated by Innovative Management Capacity, a higher-order dynamic capability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The R&D efforts do not only stimulate innovation but also enhance firms' ability to identify, assimilate and exploit new knowledge from the environment (Cohen and Levinthal. Economics Journal 99:569-596, 1989). In this paper, we assume that the principal channel of transmission of new knowledge is through I/O linkages. Our econometric evidence suggests that in addition to the firm's own R&D activities, R&D spillovers embodied in traded goods within the industry, others imported from abroad, and technology spillovers transferred from the technological frontier within an industry are important determinants of firms' productivity growth. Results suggest that domestic R&D spillovers following the I/O links between industries are of minor importance in this respect. We also analyze whether firms' absorptive capacity matters for productivity growth. Analyzing absorptive capacity is particularly important for assessing the effective contribution of spillovers from other firms. The effect of a firm's absorptive capacity is found to interact positively with imported R&D spillovers, whereas domestic rents spillovers seem to play a minor role for productivity growth. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

This case study analysis focuses on the strategic management processes and competitiveness of the Cimber Sterling airline. The aim is to discover resources and capabilities that lead to competitive advantages within the aviation industry. From an ACAP perspective, Cimber Sterling Group A/S was analysed by interviewing selected owners, managers and employees of the airline. A comparison within the airline industry regarding external factors and the strategic management of other selected low-cost airlines is part of the ACAP concept. The analysis shows to what extent Cimber Sterling Group A/S, as a Danish family business, copes with increasing competition and critical situations, such as the recent volcanic ash cloud and the financial crisis. Identifying the potential and realised capacity of the strategic management of airlines was revealed as a source of strategic competitiveness. The ACAP was improved through stakeholder experience, strategic flexibility, networking capabilities and customer orientation, leading to a competitive advantage realisation in the low-cost airline market. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Drawing on longitudinal data from 1,170 German manufacturing and service firms, econometric analyses reveal that returns from open innovation are greatest when firms maintain their internal research capacity, employ a dedicated incentive system for innovation and advocate strong cross-functional collaboration. Decision-makers are thus well advised not to take positive returns from open innovation for granted. Rather, they need to achieve excellence in key innovation management activities, if their firm is to fully harness the value of openness. © 2012 Imperial College Press."

We examined 53 collaborative development projects and we find an inverse U-shaped relationship between technological knowledge distance and innovation performance, explained by the knowledge-based view and absorptive capacity. Our results also reveal that a short managerial knowledge distance is beneficial for innovation, which can be explained by transaction cost theory.

While organizational and employee learning have been extensively studied, learning by customers in their role as co-producers is largely unexplored. To explore how customers learn to be better co-producers, we examine whether learning channels and customer characteristics impact the customer learning rate. Using longitudinal panel data consisting of 954 customers who adopted and used a bank's online banking product over a 12-month period, we find that service delivery channels can have dual effects on customer learning, acting as learning channels to accelerate customer learning and/or impeding learning through channel substitution. In addition, customers' experiences working on related technology-mediated tasks and absorptive capacity increase their learning rate. Overall, our results suggest that customer learning can be designed into the service delivery system by encouraging the use of channels with complementary learning effects and discouraging channel substitution. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

At the same time, the specific task of integrating ICTs in established products poses new challenges to management. In order to explore these challenges, an in-depth case study of this type of development has been performed at the Swedish multinational company Alfa Laval. The results from the study indicate that the integration of ICTs has consequences for management, particularly in terms of the handling of technological competences and the reformulation of existing business models. Even though most firms developing and manufacturing traditional mechanical engineering products rely on external providers for the integrated ICT components and systems, they nevertheless need to build up absorptive capacity in order to facilitate coordination. The integration of ICTs opens up new opportunities to create value for customers. However, to realise this value and also allow for the appropriation of parts of it, it may be necessary to change the established way of doing business, in terms of the business models used.

Drawing on the Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS-3) for Spain, a multiple regression model is used to study the existence of complementarity between innovation activities and their impact on innovation performance. The sample for the study is 3,964 innovative firms. First of all, the empirical results propose that the complementarity appears only between internal innovation and either external or cooperative innovation – but not with both together, which is in-line with the “absorption capacity” notion. Second, the use of external and cooperation innovation in isolation does not yield positive effects on innovation performance. This finding contradicts the substitution argument and supports the absorptive capacity argument. Finally, innovation strategies do not seem to be dissimilar between industries. The main limitation of the paper is the use of cross-section data, which implies less robust results as an empirical test. The empirical results allow the authors to recommend company managers and public administration officials to improve and support internal innovation. These activities should be combined with the high levels of external acquisitions that Spanish firms have in order to increase their innovation performance as the absorption capacity theory and this paper's empirical results suggest. The first contribution of the paper is the inclusion of the third form of innovation: cooperation.

Drawing on the absorptive capacity perspective, we argue that firms with a high level of such capacity seem to benefit more from their alliances. Specifically, three indicators of technology strategy relevant to absorptive capacity, including proportion of R&D alliances in an alliance portfolio, technological distance, and R&D intensity are explored to examine their impacts on innovation performance. Using alliance data from the Securities Data Company (SDC), patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), firm data from S&P COMPUSTAT, and co-patents granted as a proxy for the alliance innovation performance, these results show that while alliance networks potentially provide a firm with access to various benefits that can help in creating new technologies, R&D alliances in particular are more suitable than other types of partnerships to achieve this aim. Furthermore, given that information transfer and learning are key benefits of R&D alliances, moderate technological distance is needed if such alliances are to be successful. In particular, the innovation performance peaks at the moderate level of technological distance with alliance partners when this interacts with the proportion of R&D alliances in a firms alliance portfolio. Finally, R&D alliances should be regarded as a complement to rather than a substitute for a firms internal R&D. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Dynamism of Southern Engines of Growth - India and China - caused them to emerge as 'core' South. Thus, triangular innovation diffusion between dynamic and peripheral South is also simulated to show how the backward or peripheral South could catch up via South-South Cooperation in a declining North-South trends in trade.

The company was of interest because it had adopted a deliberate strategy of bringing in new management ideas from other countries. We focused on their adoption of new HRM practices. Key findings were that cultural and religious factors influenced their choices of which countries to adopt as models for their practice, the relative lack of translation of the chosen practices, difficulties in transferring practices from HQ to the hotels in the chain and the important influence of culture on the transfer process. These findings suggest that the biggest barrier to knowledge transfer was the organisation's absorptive capacity. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Then we empirically examined the existence of complementarities between corporate R&D strategies and uncovered the contextual factors. Our empirical results suggest the possible existence of a complementary relationship between in-house and joint R&D. We also discovered the firm-specific contextual variables, such as a firm's cumulative patent stocks and scientific information inflows from public research institutes and universities, that drive the decision to combine in-house and joint R&D. Our theoretical discussions on firms' diverse knowledge management processes allow more enriched understanding on these empirical findings. © eContent Management Pty Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses structural equation modelling of survey data from 218 Canadian manufacturers referring to a particular relationship with one of their customers. Findings: Results suggest that only the first dimension of the relative absorptive capacity - knowledge sharing routines - influences the knowledge transferred from the customer to the supplier. Knowledge transfer acts as a mediator between knowledge sharing routines and the supplier's operational performance improvement. Research limitations/implications: The absence of a significant association between the second dimension of relative absorptive capacity - overlapped knowledge bases - and knowledge transfer is a surprising result that should be further investigated. Originality/value: This appears to be the first study to operationalise and empirically test relative absorptive capacity and its consequences in the particular context of customer-supplier relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a model to predict which inter-related resources might enable companies to manage inter-organizational costs. We test this model using a survey of managerial accountants whose organizations are part of a supply chain. Using structural equation modeling, we conclude that the resources of internal electronic integration, external electronic integration, internal cost management, and absorptive capacity play significant direct and indirect roles in the development of an inter-organizational cost management (IOCM) resource. We find that these resources are inter-related and together are useful in enabling companies to ultimately benefit from managing inter-organizational costs. We find in particular the importance of relational resources associated with absorptive capacity in the development of an IOCM resource. Our research contributes to theory and practice by explaining how specific resources can be combined in allowing companies to better manage inter-organizational costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The FDI spillovers literature addresses this very issue, primarily examining whether the presence of foreign firms in a host market leads to technology spillovers and upgrading in domestic firms. A key finding is that spillovers depend on the absorptive capacity of the domestic firm. Yet, in conceptualizing absorptive capacity, scholars have largely overlooked how social structure shapes it. Integrating insights from social networks, technology upgrading, and innovation literatures, I emphasize that a domestic firm's ability to absorb spillovers depends on the social structure it is embedded in. I argue that ties with foreign firms reduce the constraints that domestic firms usually face in searching for and transferring in foreign technologies. However, while search benefits from sparse network structures, transfer is facilitated by cohesive ones. Also, while affect-based ties might motivate foreign firms sufficiently to share information with domestic firms at the search stage, reciprocal benefits and social monitoring conferred by common third-party ties are necessary in the transfer stage. Any effect of ties also depends on the routine repertoire of domestic firms. Put together, these arguments offer a more socialized account of the spillover process. © 2012 Academy of International Business All rights reserved."

A study gives special attention to the intrinsic nature of knowledge, absorptive capacity of the acquirer and acquiree, and inter-firm relationships as key antecedents of transfer. Design/methodology/approach: A study provides a comprehensive literature review on the antecedents of knowledge transfer in acquisitions. The paper consolidates, annotates and critiques the existing research on knowledge-related, organizational and inter-organizational antecedents of transfer in a specific, yet under-researched context of acquisitions. Findings: The paper reveals four major limitations of the current body of literature: underestimated role of ambiguous and dynamic nature of knowledge in conceptual frameworks of knowledge transfer; implicit simplifying assumptions about the role of dynamic capabilities of the two combining organizations to absorb knowledge; lack of systemic analysis of antecedents, learning processes and performance outcomes of knowledge transfer; and lack of comparative analysis of acquisitions of different types which may reveal diverse patterns of knowledge transfer. The author calls for future research to use more direct observations, longitudinal data and multiple case study methods, so that dynamics and complexity of the knowledge transfer process in acquisitions is better revealed. Originality/value: Although our understanding of the complexities of knowledge transfer in acquisitions has increased dramatically over the past years, there remain sufficient gaps and openings for further research to be addressed. As a major contribution to the field, this paper points to the high explanatory power of knowledge ambiguity, lack of absorptive capacity on behalf of the acquirer and acquiree, and the arduous relationship between the two firms as barriers to knowledge transfer in acquisitions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Maximizing the potential for innovative product adoption is a challenging task due to the complexities of the construction innovation system. A qualitative methodology involving interviews with major construction project stakeholders is employed to address the research question: 'What are the main obstacles to the adoption of innovative products in the road industry?' The characteristics of six key product innovation obstacles in Australian road projects are described. The six key obstacles are: project goal misalignment, client pressures, weak contractual relations, lack of product trialling, inflexible product specifications and product liability concerns. A snapshot of the dynamics underlying these obstacles is provided. There are few such assessments in the literature, despite the imperative to improve construction innovation rates globally in order to deliver road infrastructure projects of increasing size and complexity. Key obstacles are interpreted through an open innovation construct, providing direction for policy to enhance the uptake of innovation across the construction product supply network. Early evidence suggests the usefulness of an open innovation construct that integrates three conceptual lenses: network governance, absorptive capacity and knowledge intermediation, in order to interpret product adoption obstacles in the context of Australian road infrastructure projects. The paper also provides practical advice and direction for government and industry organizations that wish to promote the flow of innovative product knowledge across the construction supply network. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Given the dramatic environmental turbulence, this paper raises key questions: (1) What are critical factors affecting knowledge absorption from investing firms in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) and (2) whether the main factors affecting knowledge acquisition in CBAs have evolved accordingly or not. In order to identify the different learning patterns in CBAs, we divide a sample into two groups (i. e., CBAs that were formed before the crisis and those that were formed afterwards). Regression analyses show that the two most powerful explanatory variables for knowledge acquisition only in pre-crisis are prior-related knowledge and compatible organizational culture. In contrast, intent to learn and efficient internal communication play a pivotal role in acquiring foreign knowledge from multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the CBAs formed after the crisis. Integration into foreign network and participation of foreign expatriates are significant determinants irrespective of the prevailing environment conditions. Although this paper contributes to the current literature on knowledge acquisition and CBAs, we also suggest that the relative importance of the determinants of knowledge acquisition in CBAs are also essential during the economic crisis in Western economies. © 2012 Gabler Verlag."

However, many authors point out that technologies cannot be a source of competitive advantages, given their high imitability. The arguments that support this conclusion ignore that the diffusion of technology is a long and highly heterogeneous process. This heterogeneity might justify durable differences in resource endowments and profitability. The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the diffusion process and the variables that condition it. To this end, we use data from the Survey of Business Strategies, which describe the use of technologies in Spanish manufacturing firms. Our results show that the process of technology diffusion is relatively slow and is related to variables such as size, absorptive capacity, the internationalization of firm activities and whether the firm belongs to a group."

The mixed findings could be due to differences across firms in terms of the capabilities to acquire, assimilate, and transform knowledge and to simultaneously pursue both the exploitation of existing operational capabilities and the exploration for new operational capabilities. Building on the literature that suggests that manufacturing flexibility mediates the relationship between environmental uncertainty and firm performance, we explore the applicability of two organizational learning contingencies to the operations environment: operational absorptive capability and operational ambidexterity. Absorptive capacity enables the recognition and assimilation of new knowledge. Ambidexterity determines whether this knowledge will be applied for both exploration and exploitation. Using a sample of 852 manufacturing firms, we find that environmental uncertainty affects firm performance directly and indirectly through manufacturing flexibility. Furthermore, both operational absorptive capacity and operational ambidexterity moderate the relationship between environmental uncertainty and manufacturing flexibility and the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and firm performance.

Our results show that absorptive capacity is an important dynamic determinant for developing a company's innovativeness. Moreover, this relationship is best explained by two related constructs. First, the company's unlearning context is a crucial determinant for both potential capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Second, the results also indicate a tangible means for managers to enhance their absorptive capacity through information systems capabilities. © 2010 The Author(s).

While the existing literature has not produced consistent results regarding the relationship between speed and success for NPD projects, many scholars and practitioners assert that increasing NPD speed is virtually always important to NPD success. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implicit assumption that faster is better as it relates to new product success (NPS). From the perspectives of time-compression diseconomies and absorptive capacity, the authors question the assumption that speed has a linear relationship with success. The authors further argue that time-compression diseconomies depend on levels of uncertainty involved in NPD projects. Using survey data of 471 NPD projects, the hypotheses were tested by hierarchical regression analysis and subgroup polynomial regression. The results of this study indicate that NPD speed has a curvilinear relationship with NPS, and the nature of the speed-success relationship varies, depending on type and level of uncertainty. When turbulence or technological newness is high, the relationship is curvilinear, but when uncertainties are low, the relationship is linear. In contrast, the results of this study suggest a curvilinear relationship under conditions of low market newness but not when market newness is high. The present paper asserts that time-compression diseconomies and absorptive capacity are important theoretical constructs in understanding speed in NPD. The different impact of market newness and market turbulence on NPD speed supports the distinction of newness and turbulence as two different sources of uncertainty. Discussion focuses on the implications of NPD speed under the different conditions of uncertainty. NPD teams need to pursue NPD speed as a critical strategy, but it is necessary to analyze the source and degree of uncertainty about projects before a time-based strategy is selected. In order to address the challenges of high uncertainty, a firm needs to probe, learn, and iterate fast. In particular, NPD teams need to distinguish between the different requirements for new products in emerging and new markets, and those in fast-changing markets. Moreover, NPD teams need to balance how fast they need to go with how fast they can go by considering team absorptive capacity and customer absorptive capacity. © 2012 Product Development & Management Association."

To that end, multinational corporations (MNCs) are asking their IT departments to support both the exploitation of existing knowledge and the unit-to-unit transfer of new know-how derived in units from exploration. Nonetheless, new know-how derived from exploratory research, development and experience in one unit can be difficult to transfer to units that can exploit that know-how to commercial ends. The factors that impede the transfer of new know-how have been conceptualized as ""factors of stickiness"". In this paper, we present a theoretical model of organizational factors that can cause (or conversely mitigate) stickiness in the flow of new know-how between MNC units. To test the six hypotheses of the model, we used meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) of 31 empirical studies, representing 10,432 cases of new know-how transfer between units. The result of MASEM shows that the factors of receiving units' potential absorptive capacity and transmission channel in form of social capital that is enacted through its three dimensions (i.e.; embedded social ties between units, institutional shared vision of units, and interorganizational trust of units) affect recipient subsidiaries' capability to exploit new know-how in practice (i.e.; realized absorptive capacity), thus effectuating its transfer. Based on our findings, we propose research directions within the context of agile information systems development, distributed software projects, and management of information systems functions in MNCs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on an in-depth empirical analysis of Heathrow airport's Terminal 5 project, we find that innovation hinges on technology adoption decisions that are governed systematically by two intertwined determinants - assessment of expected profitability and development of absorptive capacity, both of which are distributed across various interdependent actors. On an ad hoc basis, technological decisions are also affected by other factors, namely attitudes toward risk, politics, and (lack of) established standards. We reveal how a schedule-driven project framing creates an underlying boundary condition that constrains the longitudinal process of building a 'whole collective' with capacity to absorb new technologies. The innovation potential of mega projects is thus subjected to a fundamental, unifying tension: on the one hand, they offer a one-off opportunity to invest in cutting-edge technologies and innovate socio-technical systems; on the other hand, project stakeholders have limited time to develop capacity to absorb novel technologies and negotiate differences on assessments of profitability and risk. Stakeholders may therefore be compelled to agree to adopt proven technologies upfront to reduce uncertainty and mitigate risks, thus limiting the innovation potential of new infrastructure development. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

This theory-building, exploratory qualitative case study discusses the need for top and middle management to be ambidextrous and to change their styles to better facilitate the three different learning processes. We found that an exploratory learning process was facilitated when both top and middle management used a transformational style, a transformative learning process was facilitated when top management used a transformational style while middle management used a transactional style, and an exploitative learning process was facilitated when both top and middle management used a transactional style. Furthermore, for each of the three learning processes, the leadership styles of top and middle management operated more effectively when certain attributes of the organizational context were emphasized. © SAGE Publications 2011."

Strategic innovation aims at a re-conceptualisation of business models, the creation of uncontested market spaces, and leaps in customer value. By using the learning-process perspective of absorptive capacity (exploratory, assimilative, transformative, and exploitative learning processes), we suggest that transformative learning processes in particular, play a key role in strategic innovation. In addition, a follower strategy and participative role in the knowledge network, instead of a first-mover strategy and a dominant role in the knowledge network, do indeed promote strategic innovation. Companies should not only manage the accumulation of external knowledge, but also adapt their combinative capabilities (systematisation, coordination, and socialisation of knowledge) in order to succeed with strategic innovation.

Recent publications have called for more dynamic and cognitive approaches in marketing relationship research. Also, established definitions of absorptive capacities have been questioned. This article aims to address propositions that take these overlooked and questioned elements into consideration, which can help explain conducts and dependencies, and affect relationship durability. Design/methodology/approach: The authors put forward four propositions by combining literature on interfirm relationships and managerial cognition with evolutionary ideas from marketing and management literature. Findings: The authors embrace a redefinition of potential absorptive capacity (the disposed capacity to absorb knowledge) and realized absorptive capacity (the absorption of knowledge actually performed). This distinction can, to some extent, be explained by the degree of cognitive attention given to the marketing relationship. Moreover, asymmetrically realized absorptive capacity vis-à-vis a partner substantially influences the dynamics of partners' conduct and dependency, which may vary the risk that the relationship will end. Practical implications: The propositions illustrate how a motivated partner that gives more attention to the relationship is more likely to absorb more knowledge than its counterpart, which can threaten the durability of a relationship. Thus, managers need to be able to understand possible long-term consequences of the partner's conduct in order to avoid losses of joint strategic resources and relational benefits. Originality/value: By advocating an evolutionary approach, an impetus for more dynamism in marketing relationship research is presented. This study also shows the importance of including the longitudinal dimension in analysis if one wants to understand change in - and durability of - marketing relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The discussion is framed by the concept of absorptive capacities and more particularly, by a revised perspective that differentiates between potential and realized capacities. In so doing, it emphasizes the dynamic aspects behind the process of moving from potential to realized capacities. Inherent aspects of tissue culture technology overlap and interact with socio-economic conditions; and become key to the dynamics of knowledge advancement, production, and distribution of benefits. In this context, policy choices play a major role in directing the dynamics towards a more distributed technological development. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Since efficiency -related problems differ in complexity and structure from those associated with adaptability, their optimal governance differs. While the former benefits from outsourcing, the latter is better off managed within organizational boundaries. In addition, a firm's ability to engage in complex problem solving buffers the efficiency-adaptability trade-off that occurs with increasing levels of outsourcing. In this study, we find support for our theses. Although outsourcing yields efficiency gains up to a certain point, it hurts adaptability. However, a firm's absorptive capacity mitigates this trade-off.

In a second stage these driving forces are observed with regard to their impact on the decision to locate innovation activities in various countries and regions (China, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and North America) as well as in groups of countries with similar levels of knowledge (""country clubs""). The analysis is based on the Mannheim Innovation Panel survey which represents the German CIS (Community Innovation Survey) contribution. Two survey waves have been combined, resulting in a sample of about 1,400 firms. The results show that the decision to perform innovation activities abroad is mainly driven by organisational capabilities such as absorptive capacities, international experience and existing technological competences of the respective firm. Innovation barriers at the German home base such as lack of labour and high innovation costs prompt the set-up of later-stage innovation activities abroad while the lack of demand demonstrates a barrier to the internationalisation decision for the development and manufacturing of new products. Location decisions receive the strongest influencing effects from the international experience of the firm. Firms which innovate in developing countries seem to require a more extensive level of international experience through international R&D cooperation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
"Editor's introduction: Distributional consequences of emerging technologies","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855791653&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2010.09.009&partnerID=40&md5=d68b1662ad8f50a3bd7259ba49582577","Emerging technologies have a great potential to exacerbate inequalities. The papers in this special section represent case studies of the ways five different technologies interacted with particular national contexts to produce distributional effects. A central hypothesis of the study was that the same technological project would have different distributional consequences under different national conditions; this was confirmed. Public interventions shaped the trajectories of the technological project through intellectual property and anti-trust provisions as well as regulations, much more than through the research agenda itself. These technologies were not associated with large gains or losses in jobs, but rather with modest shifts downward in numbers and upwards in skill requirements. Price was not the only determinant of how far the technologies diffused; skills and infrastructure were also important. In sum, distributional consequences take many forms. ""Diffusion"" consists of both push and pull, need and absorptive capacity. The relevant decision makers are in both the public and private sectors, and a broad range of policies affects this process, not just science, technology, and innovation policies. There are many options for public intervention, but no one size fits all countries. 11Full results are being reported in a book that synthesizes results across technologies and countries.

"Interaction of individual and social antecedents of learning effectiveness: A study in the IT research context","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856408983&doi=10.1109%2fTEM.2011.2144988&partnerID=40&md5=087bb57749bba60f9fc136bf8750cd94","Individual learning is key to performance for knowledge-intensive activities such as information technology research. Individuals learning effectiveness is inevitably influenced by both individual differences and the social forces of their surrounding context. While learning can be arduous and the effects of both sets of factors need to be understood to facilitate it, prior studies have typically examined social and individual aspects separately. This study integrates individual factors from the symbolic cognition perspective with social factors from the situated cognition view in a model to explain learning effectiveness. The model was tested through a survey of individual learners working on information technology-related research projects. The findings indicate that the individual factors of knowledge sourcing initiative and learning orientation as well as the social factors of shared understanding and prosharing norms have significant influences on individuals learning effectiveness. Further, network ties and prosharing norms interact with learning orientation and knowledge sourcing initiative, respectively, to influence learning effectiveness. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. © 2006 IEEE."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on data collected from a sample of small KIBS firms located in Scotland. The methodological approach is novel in that it utilises the results of an online benchmarking tool allowing firms to gauge their intellectual asset base in comparison with other firms. Findings: The paper finds that approaches to the strategic management of intellectual assets vary significantly according the size and type of KIBS firm. Differences in these approaches impact on the development of effective innovation processes, with resource deficiencies in smaller firms constraining their innovation capability. Practical implications: It is concluded that small KIBS firms face particular challenges in managing the innovation process and establishing sustainable knowledge management practices, and may benefit from targeted policy intervention. Originality/value: Unlike many other studies of KIBS firms, this paper focuses on how small KIBS firms manage their own knowledge processes as part of their strategic management approach for creating competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This process of valorization has been studied extensively, mainly with a focus on universities. In the Netherlands, there is a binary system of higher education comprising universities and the more practice-oriented colleges of higher education. From 2001 these colleges have played an increasingly important role in KT, which gives rise to the question of whether there are differences in the frequency and structure of KT involving universities and KT involving colleges. Colleges appear easier to access for SMEs, because of their focus on business practices. The interactions between universities and SMEs are more localized, suggesting the need for face-to-face interactions in those contacts. Furthermore, the results reiterate the importance of the absorptive capacity of firms and previously established contacts of entrepreneurs in explaining firm–HEI interaction. © 2012, © 2012 SAGE Publications."

A theoretical model is proposed and tested using structural equation modeling techniques based on survey data collected from firms that have been using e-commerce in their operations for an average of 4 years and have more than 25% of sales or procurement via e-commerce channels. We find that top management participation is a key contributor to the development of a firm's potential and realized absorptive capacities. These two forms of absorptive capacity in turn contribute to the firm's integrative capability, theorized as a form of dynamic capability, which then impacts the firm performance indicators. Different contributions of the two absorptive capacities are delineated, so are the effects of top management on the absorptive capacities. Theoretical and practical contributions of these findings are discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Despite numerous accounts showing its potential to lead to competitive advantage, the understanding of how and under what conditions firms introduce management innovations is still surprisingly limited. This study proposes that processes that influence the learning capacity of TMTs play an important role in stimulating management innovation. More specifically, we propose that TMT reflexivity and TMT minority dissent enhance management innovation as they provide a continuous check of the appropriateness of management practices for achieving firm goals. Furthermore, we argue that these managerial learning processes are more effective in enhancing management innovation in firms with a high level of absorptive capacity. Empirical testing on a cross-industry sample of Dutch firms provides support for the proposed relationships."

Early articles proposed a positive relationship, while subsequent research supported a negative influence on innovation from product diversification based on observable reductions in research and development expenditures. Such findings also suggest a negative influence on absorptive capacity from increasing product diversification. This paper uses an absorptive capacity perspective to revisit the relationship. Together with related literature on knowledge creation and transfer processes, a positive association between related product diversification by firms and the quantity of created technological knowledge is suggested. Evidence to support such a relationship is provided using patent data from technology-based firms in a sample of 1997 firm years between 1990 and 2006. Some evidence of a negative association between knowledge creation and very high levels of unrelated diversification is indicated, qualifying and supporting the M-form hypothesis. The findings more closely align understandings of the relationship between product diversification and innovation with the relationship between product diversification and firm performance. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

In order to do this, we employ data from the 'Central de Balances' database, which covers both manufacturing and services firms during the period 2003-2007, and use an estimator proposed by Wooldridge [2005. Simple solutions to the initial conditions problem in dynamic nonlinear panel data models with unobserved heterogeneity. Journal of Applied Econometrics 20, no. 1: 39-54] for dynamic random effects discrete choice models. The empirical exercise provides evidence on the positive link between spillovers and the innovative behaviour of companies, not just for the knowledge generated in the same industry, but also for that generated in the same region or by the public sector. Moreover, this link is stronger for those firms with a higher capacity to absorb those spillovers. This ability not only works through firms' R&D capabilities, but also through factors such as the quality of the labour force, the share of temporary employment and the amount of resources spent in training. In addition to these factors, we find that innovation performance exhibits a high degree of inertia. Further, some other observed firm characteristics, such as size, sales growth, export behaviour, sector capital intensity or financial structure variables, are also found to be relevant determinants of the likelihood of innovation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Thus, a firm needs to be capable of identifying and valuing the potential value of certain external knowledge, i.e. absorptive capacity. Most of the studies regarding search patterns are reduced mostly to medium-high and high-tech industries in which only the level of investment in R&D activities as determinant of a firm's search strategy is considered. In addition, when the flows of external knowledge arise from firm-university interactions, the evidence is still inconclusive, specifically for SMEs and low-medium-tech environments. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to explore the pattern of a firm's search strategy through its absorptive capacity to acquire external flows of knowledge from universities and RTOs. The paper draws especially on the role of non-R&D innovation activities in low-medium-tech sectors. Seven hundred and forty three innovative firms from the Spanish Ministry of Industry are analysed. Results suggest that human resources and other non-R&D activities are the core drivers explaining the cooperation agreements to access external knowledge from universities and RTOs. Surprisingly, R&D expenditures do not contribute to the explanation.

Based upon an in-depth case study of SEMATECH we add to the literature as follows: first, we introduce NAC and NDC, venturing beyond the organization or dyad as the unit of analysis. Second, we adopt a practice perspective in order to illustrate how SEMATECH is able to engage in NAC- and NDC-related activities, primarily by means of three practices, that is, congregating, roadmapping and offering access. These practices re-inform each other, allowing SEMATECH, in effect, to coordinate the network's knowledge-related activities with regard to knowledge outside of the network. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

However, in striving to achieve specific outcomes, firms may incur significant risks. Although many companies claim to have attained substantial benefits from their virtual world initiatives, many others have recently scaled down or even abandoned their experimental virtual world projects. This paper assesses the value proposition of virtual world initiatives from the real options perspective. Specifically, we argue that virtual worlds act as a firm's growth option, and we adopt the lens of real options to evaluate the value of this emerging and uncertain technological platform. We employ the event study method to assess the stock market's perception of the future revenue streams of 261 virtual world initiatives announced between 2006 and 2008. Our results indicate that, overall, the market reacts positively to virtual world initiatives. Our findings also show that investors' reactions to virtual world initiatives are contingent on four key characteristics of virtual world initiatives: interpretive flexibility (i.e., technologies that allow managers to experiment), divisibility (i.e., ability to incrementally implement the technology), strategic importance (i.e., an initiative that affects a process of strategic importance to the firm), and exploitable absorptive capacity (i.e., ability to exploit the knowledge acquired through the initiative).

Based on micro data we show that the importance of external knowledge is positively correlated with participation in standardization. This suggests that firms aim to access the knowledge of other companies and stakeholders in order to increase their own knowledge base. The analysis also shows that firms cooperating with different actors are more likely to join standardization. Due to the positive relationships with incoming knowledge spillovers and forms of cooperation, we conclude that standardization represents a specific form of collaborative knowledge-sharing and knowledge-creating strategy. In addition, we are able to show that absorptive capacity measured via companies' research intensity promotes the involvement in standardization. © 2012 IEEE."

Tacit knowledge transfer is positively influenced by four key factors: Absorptive capacity of target unit, source unit's motivational disposition to share knowledge, cultural compatibility, and the extent of personal communication between foreign agents. It is proposed that the level of transfer of tactic knowledge between agents from collectivist cultures will be higher than the level of tacit knowledge transfer between agents from individualist cultures. It is also proposed that when there is cultural difference between foreign agents, the level of tacit knowledge transfer involving a source from a collectivist culture and a target from an individualist culture will be lower than transfer between an individualist source and a collectivist target. However, the proposed relationships are influenced by factors such as nature of knowledge, expectations of reciprocity, and the quality of interpersonal relationship between foreign agents. Several ideas for overcoming knowledge transfer obstacles and enhancing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, as well as research implications of the proposed model are also discussed in detail.

These ventures can compete by being simple (focused) or applying varied ways to compete. The likelihood of these ventures remaining competitive depends on their ability to build novelty into their products and operations, an activity that requires infusing knowledge into their operations. Most ventures, however, have limited knowledge bases and the reach (scope) of their external connections is limited, a factor that prompts them to tap into different external sources in their local areas. This article reports an empirical study of 140 new ventures located in seven regional clusters in Spain. The results show that new ventures can enrich the variety of their strategic repertoire by accessing diverse sources of external knowledge and being exposed to external novel knowledge, while absorptive capacity moderates this relationship. The degree of social development of these clusters also has a positive impact on the strategic variety of new ventures, exhibiting an inverted U-shape curve. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

To diffuse eco-innovation, public support programs have been established as inter-organizational networks between local authorities and smaller companies. Based on seven public-private partnership cases from the eco-efficiency Ecoprofit initiative, we identified three behavioral patterns (hold-up, step-up, and frontrunner) developed by the companies within the partnership. These were the result of an interaction between the companies’ green strategy and their related level of absorptive capacity, which influenced their ability to respond to the handholding processes offered in the partnership. Reactive companies mostly benefit from agent-based instruments (e.g., individual consulting). More proactive companies can also capitalize on peer-based handholding (e.g., ‘clubs’). The longitudinal research design shows that public-private partnerships can stimulate adaptations in a company’s green strategy over time. Propositions and an integrated framework are developed with implications for policy makers. © 2012, Copyright CCSBE/CCPME."
"The economic impact of spillovers from R&D and innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896977602&partnerID=40&md5=6397d0ab00aa6f2226b6ac8cb0fd409e","In light of globalisation of knowledge generation, Science and Technology have opened up previously distinct borderlines now favoring overlapping if not merged fields. Hence innovation becomes more complex by bundling different technological solutions in new products, processes, services and business models, which stem from different scientific and technological roots. Thus spillovers are an essential precondition towards the establishment of new interdisciplinary fields of knowledge, science and technology. The paper reviews and synthesizes literature on spillovers, introduces a typology of spillovers and a taxonomy of spillover channels, estimates the economic impact of spillovers. Special attention is paid to assessing recipient's capabilities to absorb new knowledge thus gaining advantages for own development. The author concludes that knowledge spillovers have a positive impact on performance of a recipient (company, country or region) as long as it possesses sufficient absorptive capacity. Spillovers might under certain circumstances lead to strengthening competition between knowledge recipients at the cost of the place of origin. Nonetheless the latter still is in a position to use instruments of legal protection of own knowledge (under certain circumstances), build on the existing competences and capacities and invest in the next frontier of knowledge and technology in certain fields and moreover create a boom in the field of knowledge and technology generated using marketing instruments extensively."

This traditional manufacturing industry is currently undergoing changes due to market and technological developments. By discussing industrial and technological lifecycles, this paper aims to establish the extent to which these changes affect the R&D collaboration networks in the industry. The paper also provides insight regarding how the incumbents in this industry change their innovation activities in the face of a new science-based technology - nanotechnology - which is argued to have a significant impact on innovative activities in many traditional and high-tech industries. The results suggest that the Finnish pulp and paper industry is adapting to the changing innovation environment by increasing internal R&D investment and by extending and diversifying its R&D collaboration networks. The results also indicate that nanotechnology is seen as a potential new source of business for the pulp and paper industry but that investment will be required, particularly in absorptive capacity, to take advantage of these new technologies. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company."

From it, I derive the notion of cognitive distance. I use the resulting insights to discuss the well-known notions of absorptive capacity and exploitation and exploration from the innovation literature, and the way in which exploitation and exploration are connected. In the analysis I model practice in terms of the notion of a script. Cognitive difference (‘distance’) complicates but also enriches collaboration, and this positive effect is related to the notion of bridging structural holes. Among other things, the analysis yields an underpinning of the idea that application is not just a result of research but also a basis for ideas for research, in two-way traffic between theory and practice, and between research and application. The analysis also has implications for innovation policy, in particular for the currently popular principle of focus and mass. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012."

Design/methodology/approach – A regional case study (Region Centro of Portugal) is used, employing secondary and primary data in order to measure specialized critical mass of a region’s clusters and analyze their innovative behavior following the European Cluster Observatory (ECO) methodology. Findings – Combining the different nature of data (primary and secondary), this paper identifies the specialized critical mass of a region’s cluster, makes statements about the role of clusters in a regional context, and demonstrates how a regional clustering approach is important to understanding the innovative process. Based on an empirical survey, three types of clusters were found: basic, intermediate and advanced. Research limitations/implications – Among the research limitations is the undersized sample of primary data which does not allow deep findings to be drawn about the innovative behavior of the clusters in a general way. Therefore, future research should focus on this area, extending the empirical analysis presented here to add qualitative indicators on innovative behaviour, to calculate the impact of absorptive capacity in the case of regional clusters. Practical implications – This study provides a consistent methodology of cluster operation which could be useful for undertaking comparative work within regions’ clusters across different sectors and countries, to reinforce the importance of the current discussion of policy clusters, and to identify specific requirements and needs of each cluster in order to improve the quality of decision making and to draw some policy implications. Originality/value – This paper is the first to measure specialized critical mass of a region’s clusters at the enterprise level and to explain cluster innovative behaviour, combining primary and secondary, based on ECO criteria. Furthermore, it provides initial empirical evidence and an amount of significant findings to support managers and policymakers in the understanding of regional and innovation clustering of small to medium-sized enterprises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited"
"Clustering and the internationalisation of high technology small firms in film and television","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891867463&partnerID=40&md5=a8dbe717f59104e77c500e75c9f47db3","This chapter draws together three strands of literature on clustering, entrepreneurship and international business, and examines the relationships between these three phenomena in promoting firm formation and growth within clusters. The evidence drawn on includes econometric models based on the unique International Trade in Services Film and Television dataset, an indepth interview survey and other questionnaire survey data. The key conclusions are firstly that strong clusters promote entrepreneurship, which in turn promotes cluster strength in a self-reinforcing manner. Secondly, some firms are better able than others to benefit from cluster locations due to their superior firm competencies and absorptive capacity. Thirdly, cluster strength and internationalisation are mutually reinforcing. Cluster strength contributes to the ability of entrepreneurial firms to expand overseas via export sales, licensing and FDI. Evidence is presented that indicates firms have a greater intensity of export and import activity if they have resource strengths, some of which are derived from their membership of a strong cluster. Strong clusters also attract multinational firms and in the case of the London media cluster, although those multinationals appear somewhat less embedded than nonmultinational enterprises (MNEs), they are nevertheless quite strongly embedded. This means that there is a second important cluster feedback loop as spillovers from MNEs to local firms enhance cluster strength, which attracts further multinationals. The acquisition of high performing firms by overseas MNEs does not appear to have reduced either their performance or their embeddedness in a cluster. Fourthly, the nature of internationalisation strategies is conditioned by firm and industry characteristics. In particular, the extent to which tacit knowledge is embodied in a product emerges as being influential in terms of decisions on which internationalisation mode to use. Finally, the resource-based view of the firm emerges as a useful integrative framework for understanding the interplay between clusters, entrepreneurship and internationalisation strategies. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In an external business environment that is constantly changing, extant literature on strategic management advocates the need to focus on factors internal to the organization such as resources and capabilities to sustain their performance. Specifically, they need to develop dynamic capabilities in order to survive and prosper under conditions of change. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamic capabilities needed in the management of transport infrastructure assets using a multiple case study research strategy. This paper produced a number of findings. First, the empirical evidence showed that the core infrastructure asset management processes are capacity management, options evaluation, procurement & delivery, maintenance management, and asset information management. Second, the study identified five dynamic capabilities namely stakeholder connectivity, crossfunctional, relational, technology absorptive and integrated information capability as central to executing the strategic infrastructure asset management processes well. These findings culminate in the development of a capability model to improve the performance of infrastructure assets in an increasingly dynamic business environment."

Popular wisdom suggests that a consumer driven approach to the product development process is key to a firm's competitive success. Organizational learning research however has argued that a narrow focus on customer needs restricts a firm's ability to search for unconventional product market opportunities. Hence, a greater openness to external ideas that extend beyond the interests of the consumer has been called for. In drawing on concepts of absorptive capacity and strategic alliances, this study develops a conceptual model to examine a firm's product development process. This conceptual model is examined in the biotechnology industry. Regression analyses show a firm's absorptive capacity exhibits a positive yet diminishing effect on a firm's ability to introduce products to the market. Findings also indicate the type of knowledge possessed by a firm yields a distinct moderating effect to the product benefits of alliances. © 2011 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA)."

Absorptive capacity depends on the capacity of firms to establish intra- and extra-cluster knowledge linkages. We put forward in this article the fact that social capital fosters intra-cluster knowledge linkages, and cluster's internationalization the extra-cluster knowledge ones. Therefore, social capital and internationalization are key elements to increase the absorptive capacity of a cluster and its growth.

First, we analyze the mechanisms that facilitate knowledge diffusion across firms within IDs, the enabler of cross-firm knowledge transfer (absorptive capacity) and the process of producing new knowledge by combination. Within this analysis, we consider the formation of new firms resulting from the break-away of human resources from existing district firms (spin-offs) as a particular form of knowledge transfer and production within districts. Knowledge production by combination may take place not only within boundaries of IDs, but also involve external sources. We suggest that innovations made by combining internal and external knowledge have played an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of IDs. Finally, again from the cognitive perspective, we address the issue of how globalization impacts on district systems, concentrating on the positive role that two different types of local actors play in their reproduction and evolution: the global-local firms and institutions providing knowledge-intensive business services. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

Using the 2006 Korean Innovation Survey of service industries, I test whether and how these factors influence the degree of openness for Korean service firms. I find the following: first, a firm becomes more open to external sources by about 0.04 units when the appropriability strategy becomes tighter in one additional scale. Second, a firm becomes more open by 0.513 units when the share of highly educated employees increases by 1%. A startup is less open than an established firm by up to 0.457 units. As firm size increases in terms of employment by 1%, the firm becomes more open by 0.02 units. In Korean service industries, having highly educated employees and being a startup seem to be more influential factors for a firm's openness. © 2011 Copyright Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME)."

Through a case- and literature-based iterative process of analytical induction, three organizational capabilities are derived: climate knowledge absorption as an essential information generating and internalizing capability, climate-related operational flexibility as a short-term adjustment capability, and strategic climate integration as a long-term, innovation-focused capability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

But is the concept new or does it express old realities? The literature review of this case study found that the term ""open innovation"" is recent and that its development has been facilitated by technological innovations. The case study collected data over a period of eight months from an agrifood SME in Quebec, Canada. The aim was to go beyond the basic model of open innovation and integrate dynamic, absorptive and appropriative capacities into a new working open innovation model. Initial results show that components associated with the basic open innovation model such as intellectual property, joint R&D and co-product development are present as well as certain organizational capacities. The difficulty of applying the concept is due to its interactions rather than its components taken individually. The study concludes that further work is needed to extend the applicability and the foundations of open innovation. © 2012, IGI Global."

Much of the prior research on absorptive capacity focuses on characterizing the factors that influence absorptive capacity within organizations. However, the mechanism of how related factors affect absorptive capacity across interdependent organizations in project networks remains less explored. This paper extends a simulation model of project network learning to explore the absorptive capacity of project networks where periodic external innovations exist. This model is utilized in a series of simulation experiments to untangle the effects of varying types of innovation and degrees of relational instability in a project network. We establish a measure of project network absorptive capacity and develop an argument that relational instability moderates the project network's absorptive capacity for different types of innovation.

Geographic clustering around centers of technical excellence increases economies of scale around employment, productivity, growth, and innovation, creating competitive advantage for the location as a whole and for firms that choose to locate there. Firms must possess the absorptive capacity, the capability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends to leverage this knowledge.

We conceptualized social capital along three dimensions (structural, relational and contextual) and examined the relationships between social capital along these dimensions and two types of performance (managerial and innovative), using data collected from the strategic product development departments of six large Korean manufacturing firms. As expected, we found a significant relationship between the centrality of a network and individual performance. When network centrality was decomposed into three types (advice centrality, influence centrality and idea centrality), however, the relative strength of each type changed significantly based on performance type. We also found that the number of weak ties had a significant positive effect both on innovative and managerial performance. When considered together with network centrality and absorptive capacity, however, weak ties turned out to be non-significant as predictors of managerial performance, but the strongest predictors of innovative performance. In contrast, absorptive capacity had a positive effect on both types of individual performance, while its strength as a determinant of individual performance was weaker than that of network centrality and weak ties. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper engages in a debate and critically reflects on issues regarding knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity in the context of business interactions between Russian and Western firms. Findings: The paper revisits the notions of ""knowledge"", ""knowledge transfer"" and ""absorptive capacity"" and argues that moving away from a functionalist framework is useful when analyzing these terms in the context of Russian-Western business settings. The paper also discusses the applicability and relevance of some Soviet management practices in contemporary Russia and in conducting business with Western partners. The role of Russian business schools in reproducing, generating and disseminating knowledge is also discussed. Research limitations/implications: The paper is a continuation of the discussion on issues and questions related to knowledge transfer between Russian and Western firms. It outlines research directions worth pursuing in the future. Practical implications: Western managers are advised to treat knowledge transfer as a two-way learning process rather than seeing themselves merely as a source of superior knowledge that needs to be transferred to Russian business partners. Russian managers will benefit from understanding the dynamics of knowledge transfer processes and refining their view on absorptive capacity.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers a critical analysis of issues regarding knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity in the context of business interactions between Russian and Western firms. Findings: Based on the author's 25 years of experience in knowledge transfer between Western and Russian counterparts (managers, companies and researchers), the generic concepts ""knowledge"", ""Western"" and ""Russian"" no longer provide meaningful points of reference for actual knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications: Research so far has failed to develop the tools for realistic assessment of current Russian and Western absorptive capacity and has provided inadequate explanations for the hurdles, resistances and other barriers still entailed in the process of knowledge transfer between the two sides. This commentary suggests that the basic assumptions behind the scholarly literature about knowledge transfer between Western and Russian interactants should be examined carefully and that research should focus on identifying the factors that facilitate as well as the factors that impede effective knowledge transfer. The scholarly conversation on the topic needs to continue, particularly through genuine collaboration between Russians and Westerners and between researchers and practitioners. Practical implications: It is recommended that a system is needed for establishing and sustaining effective knowledge transfer which would both enrich understanding of how such transfer actually works and articulate specific behavorial guidelines that will help each side to transfer their relevant knowledge and increase their own absorptive capacity more effectively.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that FDI and trade can contribute to overall domestic productivity growth only when the technology gap between domestic and foreign firms is not too large and when a sufficient absorptive capacity is available in domestic firms. In this article we propose the terms R&D and Labor quality to capture the innovative and absorptive capacity of the country. The spillovers effects in productivity are analyzed using a stochastic frontier (SFA) approach. This productivity (in terms of total factor productivity) is decomposed using a generalized Malmquist output-oriented index in order to evaluate the specific effect in technical change (TC), technical efficiency change (TEC), and scale efficiency change (SEC). Using country-level data for 16 Latin American countries for the period 1996-2006, the empirical analysis shows positive productivity spillovers from FDI and trade only when the country has absorptive capacity in terms of R&D. FDI and trade spillovers are found to be positive and significant for scale efficiency change and total productivity factor change. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The exploration can be performed via an in-depth or broad search for resources beyond organisational boundaries. Salespeople are an essential channel for an in-depth search in relation to customers, since salespeople possess rich knowledge of the customers. In order to be useful, such knowledge has to be absorbed in the company. Most of the literature on absorptive capacity has focused on R&D, while less focus has been placed on studying the role of individuals in the development of integrative practices.

It investigates this question in three narrowly defined high technology industries by analysing the association of three R&D characteristics of acquiring firms with different measures of acquisition extent and content. The R&D characteristics referred to are: addressing R&D efforts, R&D outputs and absorptive capacity. Data was collected in each case for those firms whose combined sales revenue makes up 80% of the industry total and is used to test a set of hypotheses derived from extant literature. The findings confirm a substitutive relationship between acquisitions and acquirer research efforts as well as between acquirer and target patent output, whereas absorptive capacity is complementary to acquisition activities. The results reveal that acquirers target firms that hold a large number of patents in the fields where acquirer patenting is weak, and so address weaknesses in their own R&D output. This finding extends the extant literature on the role of external technology sourcing in the high technology context.

Based on a longitudinal data set comprising three cross-sections (1999, 2002, and 2005) of the Swiss Innovation Survey, four different types of R&D strategies could have been separated; firms combine in-house R&D with R&D co-operations (coop) or in-house R&D with external R&D (buy), or they conduct in-house R&D, external R&D, and R&D co-operations (mixed), or they exclusively rely on in-house R&D (make). It is the aim of this paper to understand what drive firms to go for different strategies. Based on econometric estimations controlling for correlations between the dependent variables and endogeneity among the independent variables, it was found that concepts related to the absorptive capacity, incoming spillovers, and appropriability, the importance of different knowledge sources, the competitive environment, costs, and skill aspects as well as technological uncertainty are essential factors to determine a firm's decision to choose a specific way to organize R&D. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

They define Absorptive Capacity (AC) as the organizational capability to organize value and assimilate external knowledge in order to increase firm innovativeness. They assume that AC is a dynamic capability that depends on prior related knowledge in the form and combines value recognition of the missing knowledge, its assimilation and application. © 2011 IEEE."

Yet this knowledge is widely distributed around the globe, so accessing and absorbing it can be very difficult. We focus on how can industrial scientists recognize, pull in, and apply so much new knowledge in their product innovation work. We frame our study with the knowing as practice perspective, which suggests how knowledge professionals draw on their embodied intuition, physical and sensory referents, and on their socially embedded interactions and work contexts. Based on 85 interviews with drug discovery scientists and managers, we develop empirically grounded theory for how these industrial scientists can access and absorb so much knowledge. We find that the collective sense of the scientist is a major medium for drawing on distributed know-how as needed to explore ill-structured problems. The collective sense of the scientist is a complex, intuitive sense that relies on the acting body of the scientist working in the lab with materials and apparatus and using all senses, similar to studies of academic scientists. However, the industrial sense of the scientist is collective - socially created, reinforced, and shared. Our analysis suggests that three social networks together produce and maintain this collective sense by creating a rich social context for knowing: 1) interactions among the sensory bodies of scientists in everyday practice; 2) connections with institutions of sciences; and 3) engagement with the overall innovation process in their firms. We describe each social network, how it works, and how it helps absorb so much knowledge. © 2011 IEEE."

The role of academic institutes is important, they bring together faculty to work on a specific scientific area, which can address a societal or commercial requirement. There are, however, certain issues with this approach, such as the need for effective research co-ordination; the importance of adequate governance mechanisms for managing across disciplines; and in the case of industry supported institutes the need to ensure academic outputs are properly aligned to industrial needs. In this context and through building on the literature on multidisciplinary institutes, a conceptual model has been generated for the development and management of institutes. This institute management system includes a process based on four main stages (design, initiate, deliver and sustain) as well as a set of governance themes. The management system has been applied to the Institute of Shock Physics at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom as part of a case study investigation. Subsequent analysis of the case study findings highlighted how the institute management system provides a broad-based and rigorous methodology to help establish new institutes and then ensure sustainable operations are achieved thereafter. Interpretation of the case study analysis emphasizes the role of the institute's leadership and faculty members in boundary spanning across disciplines and different organizations, and how social capital can be an important ingredient to facilitate this process. Moreover, in the case of industrial partners, their associated absorptive capacity is seen as an important enabler for ensuring companies that collaborate with university institutes have the required structures, processes and supporting culture to enable knowledge to be acquired and then deployed to advance companies' R&D capabilities. © 2011 IEEE."

The absorptive capacity is the ability of the firm to assimilate imported technology, depending on their organisational technological capabilities. There are numerous studies concerning absorptive capacity, but little empirical research has been conducted on how to measure the absorptive capacity of TT via construction projects into organisations. This paper aims to investigate and review different models of measuring absorptive capacity of TT projects from several industries (i.e., manufacturing, construction and finance) to capture the critical variables for a successful transaction of absorptive capacity within organisations. Based on the consideration of these models, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for measuring absorptive capacity in TT projects. The framework emphasises the two-key components: employees' ability and motivation which are measured through performance appraisal, employees' training, performance-based compensation, and merit based promotion. The goal of TT is to measure the level of absorptive capacity in the form of knowledge, skills and tools via construction projects to improve local technological capabilities for construction organisations. © 2011 IEEE."

A theoretical elaboration of these mechanisms precedes their empirical study within four customer-supplier dyads, centred on two focal customer organizations.The article contributes by discussing how the mechanisms act and interact to create absorptive capacity for a focal firm across relationships. We find that structural learning mechanisms, while necessary are not sufficient to explain variation in the presence of absorptive capacity across different learning contexts.

The present study intends to reveal whether the relationship between ACAP and firm performance in small and mediun sized enterprises (SMEs) is mediated by strategic alliances. Furthermore, different moderating characteristics such as age and size of the companies are taken into consideration. The findings indicate that strategic alliances of SMEs mediate both the relationship between ACAP and firm performance and the relationship between each dimension of ACAP and firm performance.

The aim is to investigate the networking competencies of stakeholders involved in the university technology transfer process using absorptive capacity theory to explore how knowledge is externally retained and maintained through these network relations. Design/methodology/approach: This paper undertakes an inductive theory building approach using in-depth multiple stakeholder interviews (n=30). The transcripts and results were analysed using open coding and NVivo. Six technology transfer meetings were also observed. Findings: The findings show that developing and maintaining network relationships can significantly aid the development and retention of knowledge within the university technology transfer process. It was found that conscious effort is made to retain relationships with network stakeholders. Prior knowledge, partner knowledge complementarity and reciprocity, resulting in collective learning, were found to motivate stakeholders to engage in external knowledge retention strategies. The results also supported suggestions in previous literature that relative capacity is an antecedent for absorptive capacity within organisations. Research limitations/mplications: The paper helps in establishing a research agenda for knowledge retention in technology transfer where traditionally the emphasis has been on development of knowledge. The absorptive capacity framework provides a consistent theoretical basis for exploring the role of stakeholders in this area. Originality/value: The paper focuses on how knowledge can be retained in technology transfer settings rather than being restricted to that of development. The use of the absorptive capacity framework has also enabled the concept of relative capacity to be developed within the research giving much needed empirical investigation into its relevance and feasibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Simultaneously, the paper also explores the key differences between R&D and non-R&D innovators. The empirical analysis is based on a representative panel of 2023 Spanish manufacturing firms from the Spanish Ministry of Industry for 2005 and 2006. Innovation in product and process is explained using non-R&D variables such as marketing, design or the hiring of tertiary degree employees. Only innovation in product is explained by R&D expenditures. Regarding innovation in process, the R&D variables work in a few specific cases. Therefore, innovation can be explained using non-R&D variables. The firms with more internal resources, those which conduct R&D activities, present a better absorptive capacity (AC) and this leads them to engage in cooperation agreements and to access external flows of knowledge. The paper has important implications for policymakers due to the fact that most policies for R&D are based just on R&D programmes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

While controlling for alliance experience, we further use new data of 196 biopharmaceutical R&D alliances to examine the effects of the technology recipient's accumulation and reactivation of technological experience on R&D alliance success. The patent-based experience measures at the level of specific technology fields provide strong support for distinguishing experience accumulation and reactivation, which positively interact in interorganizational learning. Experience reactivation strengthens the positive effects of experience accumulation on alliance performance, and it contributes to avoiding organizational inertia in intertemporal knowledge transfer. In particular, our newly developed technology-specific measures help to explain inconsistent findings of earlier studies, which often relied on firm-level R&D expenditures to capture the level of prior technological knowledge and absorptive capacity. © 2011 The Authors.

Specifically, we examine how the functional areas of R&D, manufacturing and marketing contribute to the absorption of knowledge coming from different external knowledge sources. The econometric results on a representative sample of Swiss firms show that non-R&D-based AC plays a significantly different role compared to the standard R&D-based one that is typically considered in studies on AC. We also reveal that AC is organized through a specialization of external knowledge absorption across functional areas. In particular, we find: (1) R&D is particularly important as an absorber of knowledge from public research organizations for product innovation; (2) manufacturing is important as an absorber of supplier knowledge for product innovation and of competitor knowledge for process innovation; and (3) marketing helps to absorb customer knowledge for product and process innovation as well as competitor knowledge for product innovation. We further investigate the differences between product and process innovation and find that marketing-based AC is more important for the former, although the overall analysis of these differences is less conclusive. In short, we show how functional areas play a role in the organization of AC and that firms may need an ambidextrous strategy to innovate effectively based on both upstream- and downstream-based AC. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

First, the chapter argues that parallel investments in manufacturing capability are valuable for meeting KI requirements derived from outsourcing manufacturing. Second, the analysis demonstrates how different kinds of outsourcing strategies shape the KI challenges. Third, the chapter shows how KI challenges turn up as hidden costs, performance trade-offs, or deteriorated cost reduction capability. The chapter claims that the lack of analysis of KI challenges is one explanation why previous studies on outsourcing effects have shown contradictory results.

This paper considers the case of the automobile industry, where modularity has demonstrably developed an imperfect form. Based on a literature review covering the automobile industry and modularity, we will show that a strategy of excessive outsourcing can be criticised because of the risks associated with opportunistic behaviour or the loss of absorptive capacities, and due to problems surrounding the long term fall in production costs.

Our findings support the hypothesis that the mass of patenting activity in the US and the destination country are significant factors in explaining the behavior of the US patenting activity abroad. A narrow technological gap between the source and the destination country indicates a high absorptive capacity of the destination country for the knowledge created in the source country and thus, the imitation risk increases providing an incentive to register the patent in the destination country. The effect of the physical distance is statistically ambiguous, possibly due to the spread of internet use.

It aims to open a debate among scholars and practitioners in these fields on issues related to knowledge transfer in this context. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers a critical analysis of issues regarding knowledge transfer and absorptive capacity in the context of business interactions between Russian and Western firms. Findings: The paper argues that in the later stages of post-Socialist transition it is no longer valid to attach rigidly the roles, respectively, of sole receiver to Russian and sole transmitter to Western firms. Further, the paper questions the view that problems in the knowledge transfer process are mainly attributable to the lack of absorptive capacity in Russian firms. As post-Socialist transition has advanced, this is no longer the typical case. While Russian firms have taken the learning race seriously and have substantially enriched their knowledge stock, Western firms operating in the Russian market have primarily ""learned by doing"" and have not intentionally invested in improving their own absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: The paper invites scholars to examine knowledge transfer between Russian and Western firms in a more nuanced manner that takes into account the changes evident in the latest stage of post-socialist transition. It advocates against subscribing to well-established assumptions that were valid in the beginning of post-Socialist transition, but are not aligned with changed economic realities. Practical implications: Western managers are advised to invest more effort into enhancing their understanding of the local knowledge and specific requirements and needs for knowledge transfer to local Russian firms. They should intentionally invest in enhancing their own internal absorptive capacity. Russian managers need to pay attention to the dynamics of the absorptive capacity-learning feedback loop, as well as to the distinction between potential and realised absorptive capacity. Originality/value: Unlike the mainstream literature that has examined knowledge transfer between Western and Russian firms, this paper provides a fairer, more balanced view, aligned with changed realities, of the issues associated with knowledge transfer between Russian and Western firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of spillovers calls for a detailed analysis of these effects according to the mechanisms by which they occur (namely, the increase in competition, demonstration effects, and worker mobility), and whether the size and the extent of spillovers depend on the interaction between their mechanisms and the existing technological capacities of domestic firms. Findings: The regression results are affirmative, in that domestic firms with high technological capacities appear to gain spillover benefits from FDI heightening competition, while mid- and low-technology firms benefit a lot from demonstration effects. In addition, spillovers for high- and mid-technology firms appear to be largely co-determined by the level of their human capital. Only domestic firms that invested heavily in absorptive capacity benefit from spillovers. Research limitations/implications: The evidence on spillover effects has not yet been conclusive. Hence, this paper proposes some components for a research agenda on FDI and intra-industry spillovers. Practical implications: The study provides insights for Swiss policy makers about how to promote the beneficial spillover effects of FDI. Originality/value: The process of spilling over is correctly described in a more satisfactory model and then the impact of this process is accurately identified. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This article presents a comparative case study of 12 cases of knowledge transfer between temporary inter-organizational projects and permanent parent organizations. Our set-theoretic analysis of these data yields two major findings. First, a high level of absorptive capacity of the project owner is a necessary condition for successful project knowledge transfer, which implies that the responsibility for knowledge transfer seems to in the first place lie with the project parent organization, not with the project manager. Second, none of the factors are sufficient by themselves. This implies that successful project knowledge transfer is a complex process always involving configurations of multiple factors. We link these implications with the view of projects as complex temporary organizational forms in which successful project managers need to cope with complexity by simultaneously paying attention to both relational and organizational processes. © 2010 International Project Management Association."
"Exploring call center-enabled organizational mechanisms associated with combinative capabilities","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959623743&doi=10.1108%2f00251741111143577&partnerID=40&md5=864cc7df08b7e1e7d8bd5d5c3e4a9944","The purpose of this paper is to explore the organizational mechanisms of call centers that are associated with a firm's combinative capabilities and that help to facilitate a firm's absorptive capacities. The study identifies mechanisms in terms of three types of combinative capabilities: system capabilities, coordination capabilities, and socialization capabilities. A strategy using multiple case studies was adopted; the research is primarily based on 12 interviews in four call centers from industries and public agencies in Taiwan. The study explores seven organizational mechanisms: centralized information deployment and knowledge encapsulation, active monitoring and avoidance of organizational inertia, information hubs and communication, an interactive control system, a training center and career development, relational asset creation, and job embeddedness. The contingency factors on the development of these mechanisms are also suggested. The paper bridges the “organizational mechanisms-combinative capabilities” concepts and the proposed mechanisms and contingency factors should be taken into account in call center design and implementation. If organizational mechanisms are properly designed, call centers can take on more responsibilities in managing the organization's knowledge assets. By including a firm's combinative capabilities, the analysis provides a vocabulary that researchers and practitioners can employ in similar contexts so future call center designs and implementations can be compared and benchmarked. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

We find that a moderate burden on firms' latitudinal absorptive capacity, corresponding to medium diversity in their portfolios, contributes to optimal knowledge utilization. Simultaneously increasing the demand on firms' longitudinal absorptive capacity affects this relationship negatively. Highlighting important trade-offs between latitudinal and longitudinal absorptive capacities, our findings reveal two portfolio strategies, ""telescopic"" and ""panoptic"" searches, that optimize knowledge utilization. We address important dialectics concerning absorptive capacity constraints and knowledge utilization. © Academy of Management Journal."

Although ACAP has been a widely researched construct during the last two decades, survey-based empirical studies in this field have focused only on linear relationships. The present research addresses this gap by comparing the linear and curvilinear relationships between ACAP and performance measures. Findings indicate that linear specifications result in a good approximation, but that curvilinear models are better at explaining certain relationships. To address the question of resource allocation, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view and on the theoretical considerations of Zahra and George (2002) to reveal these curvilinear effects between ACAP and performance."

Considering that just accessing external knowledge is not sufficient, this paper tries to approach this issue from the perspective of absorptive capacity building and enhancing and related knowledge and knowledge flows. From the perspective of national dimension, absorptive capacity enhancing can be regarded as having geographic elements in knowledge flows within national territory. This paper tries to utilise patent citation data made by USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) for finding out the characteristics of knowledge flows which has been underlying the catch-up phenomenon of catching-up countries. We can find out that even though there is a marked difference between advanced countries and catching-up economies in terms of strong or weak localisation of knowledge flows, it is evident that the geographic localisation exists in spite of the heavy dependence on external knowledge. In addition, even in catching-up countries, technological development accompanies a strengthening of the localisation of knowledge flows, from weak to strong as well as from low to high. Therefore, we discover that technological catch-up necessitates the active attitude toward available external knowledge, not just the passive attitude, and some mechanism to spillover the adapted knowledge to other innovative firms, and a way to innovate to confirm this attitude and mechanism. © 2011 Copyright Korean Society for Innovation Management and Economics (KOSIME)."

Two models are introduced; one model for CSC which broadly incorporates traditional intellectual capital (IC) elements and corporate reputation, and a second model for innovation from a networking perspective. The innovation model, called 'the three Es', identifies the critical central connector and broker roles within the three innovation sub-processes of exploration, engagement and exploitation. The sub-elements of CSC, being network centrality, absorptive capacity, human capital, internal capital and financial soundness are then assessed for their influence on the identified innovation roles. An analysis of the global information technology (IT) services sector is then used to illustrate the practical application of the analytical technique described.

To address this question, we first review past research on this topic and draw on a framework for examining environmental motivating forces, strategies, and employee environmental orientations. We then analyze qualitative data based on in-depth interviews with employees in financial services organizations. Our aim is to develop a richer understanding of how employees currently view IT/S issues in relation to environmental sustainability and if similarities exist between different types of financial institutions. We also assess the extent to which these employee perceptions align with both actual organizational practices, as captured in interviews with information technology managers, and practices espoused by organizations, as reflected on their corporate websites. Our findings suggest that organizations are still in the infancy stage of awareness and adoption of ""Green"" IT/S. As a result, we identify four types of gaps: knowledge gaps, practice gaps, opportunity gaps, and knowing-doing gaps. We suggest that future research should draw on absorptive capacity, organizational learning, and social marketing theories to help align employees' attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors and to drive environmental changes.© 2011 SAGE Publications."

Firms decide whether or not to undertake R&D depending on a range of factors such as market orientation, business objectives, competitive advantages and absorptive capacity. This paper studies the factors that influence this decision in peripheral locations;and for firms that do not undertake R&D, we analyse the reasons for not doing so. The research is based on data from a survey of some 250 matched firms operating in Northern Ireland, about half undertaking R&D and half not. Northern Ireland is an interesting case study because it exhibits a low level of investment in R&D despite the public subsidies and policy initiatives that have existed over the last 30 years. For firms that undertake R&D, our results mostly confirm the findings of others while for firms that do not undertake R&D the results point to a capabilities-gap rather than a resource-gap as the fundamental problem. Policy conclusions are drawn as to what might be done to boost both the amount of R&D undertaken and the number of firms engaged in R&D in peripheral regions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

However, in the era of globalisation, a firm's competitive advantage can derive not only from its internal resources, but also from all kinds of resources and capabilities that can be accessed from its embedded inter-firm networks. On the basis of the literature reviews of prior relevant researches, inter-firm networks are described by three dimensions - network intensity, network scale and network position, of which network intensity has four dimensions - sincerity of cooperation, contact intimacy, contact frequency and promise keeping. Subsequently, using data from 125 Chinese sample firms, the positive associations amongst network intensity, network scale, network position and firm technological innovation performance are confirmed, and the moderating effects of absorptive capacity on relationships between networks and firm's technological innovation performance are also supported by the data.

Based on a sample of 269 inpatriates in 10 German MNCs, the author found that inpatriates' boundary spanning is positively related to inpatriates' individual efforts to transfer knowledge and inpatriates' perceptions of HQ staff efforts to acquire subsidiary-specific knowledge. Both perceived HQ absorptive capacity and mentoring by HQ staff moderate these relationships.

Whereas, the majority of former work considers a direct effect of networks on knowledge transfer, the authors examined two intermediate mechanisms: the access to strategic resources and the individual's absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was used to collect data, via a face-to-face questionnaire with key individuals in small and medium entreprises members of consortia in Tunisia. Data were analysed with a structural equations approach, based on partial least squared-path modelling techniques. Findings: Results emphasize the impact of network size, strength of ties and absorptive capacity on the strategic resource access and the impact of indirect ties, strength and range of ties on the absorptive capacity. Moreover, while absorptive capacity positively impacts good practice transfer, no support was found to the effect of resource access. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study concerns the measuring of good practice transfer, since in literature there are often imprecise proxies. Also, while the authors have investigated the global impact of strategic resources, future research needs to treat them separately. Finally, a longitudinal study allows better capture of the evolution of the phenomenon studied. Practical implications: Top management and directors at a consortium level need to pay careful attention to the social context within which knowledge transfer efforts occur. Resources exchanged and the absorptive capacity developed through social interactions must be designed to increase knowledge flows between firms. Originality/value: The paper links two bodies of research often studied separately in inter-organizational research: literature on social networks and that on inter-organizational learning.

Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative approach is based on 18 semi-directed interviews with managers in Romanian and French exporting SMEs. With an absorptive capacity (AC) perspective, this study investigates export information processing in SMEs as a beginning-to-end process, including antecedents, inputs, and outputs. Findings: The efficiency of export information acquisition and assimilation in SMEs reflects the richness of their international experiences, as well as the richness of export information sources accessed in foreign settings. The transformation and exploitation of export information in SMEs takes various forms: sense-making, decision making, and development of new export market-related know-how and capabilities. The AC framework appears consistent with exporting SME managers' perceptions. The managers' testimonies are generally homogeneous across both countries. Research limitations/implications: This research offers valuable insights into how SMEs can acquire relevant information and then assimilate, transform, and exploit that information. It neither establishes causality across the different dimensions of AC nor links information processing and exploitation to performance. Originality/value: This research uses a dynamic AC framework to clarify export information processes. Contrary to the vast majority of existing studies that focus on a single element or phase of export information management, this study reviews the entire process, from the antecedents of information acquisition to the transformation and exploitation of export information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Since this absorptive capacity is likely to be embodied within the relationship management teams of both the supplier and client in outsourcing dyads, the human resource practices of the participating firms should have a direct bearing on levels of absorptive capacity and innovation outcomes for the relationships. This research examined four large IT relationships as case studies and presents a model of inter-organizational innovation that shows the necessity of developing the appropriate absorptive capacity to achieve innovation in outsourcing environments. From this model, the research presents three HRM practices that can help develop absorptive capacity to support innovation activities: retention of client employees with firm-specific business process knowledge rather than technical knowledge; minimization of legacy hiring practices for suppliers; and maintaining and optimal work group size for relationship management teams on both the client and supplier sides of the relationship. © 2011 Imperial College Press."

We use the relational view theory to hypothesize for a positive association between operational innovativeness of established suppliers and manufacturer performance. Furthermore, we posit that the manufacturer can enhance this value by ensuring that the supplier is performing as expected (i.e., through supplier evaluation programs), and by focusing on learning from the supplier (i.e., through absorptive capacity). We then develop hypotheses as to how the influence of these two approaches differs when working with suppliers assigned to different types of tasks. We test the hypotheses using survey responses from 136 manufacturers evaluating 272 of their suppliers. Results show that supplier evaluation programs and absorptive capacity are both effective means of augmenting the benefits of supplier operational innovativeness. Contrary to theoretical predictions, benefits of operational innovativeness of suppliers with knowledge-intensive tasks are enhanced through increasedabsorptive capacity and through increased supplier evaluation programs. © 2011 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™."

This paper develops a range of propositions that connect the constructs of effective autonomy and organisational relationships with subsidiary employment. Propositions are built on an extensive literature review based on such approaches as the resource-based view, transaction cost economics, network approach, and institutional theory. The framework developed in the paper suggests that a higher proportion of employment in skilled jobs in subsidiaries is most likely in cases where subsidiary entrepreneurship, role specialization, and absorptive capacity are higher. Conversely, the proportion is likely to be lower in cases of increased institutional distance from the parent company. The conceptual model can help parent company managers assess the likely effects of developments in effective autonomy and organisational relationships in their subsidiaries. Subsidiary managers can assess the possible impact of such factors as development of entrepreneurial activities, specialization within the multinational corporation supply chain and enhancement of absorptive capacity on the proportion of skilled jobs. This paper is the first to describe subsidiary development from a skilled job perspective. It further develops the concept of autonomy and introduces the term “effective autonomy”. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks of information and knowledge transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of shared competences is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

In order to fill the current gap in the literature, this research seeks to answer the question by focusing on the absorptive capacity perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The data were obtained by survey. A total of 1,207 questionnaires were posted to the CEOs of IJVs in Korea and 288 were returned, 42 of which were unusable, thus giving a response rate of 20.38 percent. Findings: By using OLS regressions, two key findings are reported. First, the importance of absorptive capacity of IJVs in order to acquire foreign technology from parent firms is confirmed. Second, the results indicate that IJVs with Japanese multinational firms do not show different patterns of technology acquisition compared with IJVs with Western firms. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the learning mechanisms facilitating technology acquisition in IJVs is not highly influenced by foreign origins. Originality/value: To reiterate, ""knowledge acquisition in IJVs"" has been widely in the limelight. However, no one has empirically analyzed the distinctions in learning mechanisms in IJVs with Western vs Japanese parents.

The results show that benefits from interactions with universities are multifaceted, including enhancement of the firm's explorative and exploitative capabilities. Results also indicate that firms' R&D commitments, geographical proximity to and research quality of university partners have a distinct impact on the different types of benefits from interactions with universities.

Although MNEs' capability to transfer knowledge is a key catalyst for IJVs to learn new information, extant literature currently sheds light on only student's absorptive capacity and neglects teacher's fundamental ability. Of course, there is no doubt that knowledge acquisition is not only determined by knowledge transfer capacity but also highly influenced by absorptive capacity. However, what we suggest here is that knowledge transfer capacity should not be omitted in the discussion of knowledge transfer. We design a series of propositions to test positive relationships between the capability of foreign firms and IJVs' technology acquisition. Using a sample of IJVs in Korea, the paper contributes to the literature by confirming that IJVs' learning also significantly depends on some key factors associated with foreign parents' capabilities. Based on the results, this study also provides some useful implications for MNEs which intend to establish IJVs in foreign markets. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Unlike the recent studies that suggest that industrial cluster comprises disconnected leader-centered communities, we argue that the different leader-centered communities within the knowledge systems of industrial clusters are not disconnected from each other. Instead, those communities are inter-connected through the so-called 'knowledge spanning mechanisms'. Regarding the interaction dimension of technological learning pattern, this paper argues that in analyzing learning behavior in the knowledge networks of industrial clusters, it is necessary to synthesize the learning opportunity perspective and the absorptive capacity perspective to better understand and explain the similarities and dissimilarities in technological learning behavior among different cluster types, across cognitive subgroups, and between product innovation and process innovation. Our study reveals that in the context of emerging countries, the following four factors are decisive for technological learning opportunities inside the knowledge networks of industrial clusters: the underlying complexity of technology in clusters, the inter-connectedness between product and process, path dependency in knowledge searching, and the incremental nature of a cluster's technological development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The information has been obtained from a sample composed by 81 Spanish ceramic tiles firms. The results show that the ability to acquire knowledge is higher in prospectors than in defenders and analyzers, and that the transformation and exploitation abilities are higher in the prospector firms than in the defenders, whereas no differences are observed in the knowledge assimilation capacity."

Inbound open innovation describes inward technology transfer, whereas outbound open innovation refers to outward technology transfer. Traditionally, inward technology transfer has received considerable attention because most prartitioners and academics focus on the technology recipient's absorptive capacity. In contrast, the role of the technology source has been relatively negleded. This article addresses the concept of desorptive capacity, which refers to a firm's ability to identify technology transfer opportunities and to transfer technology to the recipient. The notion of market knowledge in the concept of desorptive capacity deepens our understanding of many firms' managerial difficulties in implementing active technology transfer strategies. Thus, desorptive capadty enriches our understanding of the dynamics of outward technology transfer. It provides new insights into the success or failure of interorganizational technology transactions."

Descriptions of each innovation include the new technologies, the evolving market structures, and how the innovating companies managed their risks during the transitions. Findings – This paper finds that two contemporary theories on absorptive capacity and disruptive innovations retain validity and remain broadly applicable even as market structures change overtime from oligopoly and cartel to free market competition.

For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has; however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of ""absorptive capacity"" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study links social capital from three types of B2B networks of young technology firms with their initial public offering (IPO) value. The authors identify three relevant types of absorptive capacity that facilitate the transformation of B2B social capital into IPO value. For the transformation to occur, the authors find that young firms need not only the opportunity to access the resources provided by B2B relationships but also the ability to leverage them through the complementary capability-namely, absorptive capacity. They test the hypotheses on a sample of 177 IPOs, and the results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures. As one of the first studies in marketing-finance interface to focus on young firms, the findings provide novel insights, such as the deleterious financial consequence of having marketing and research-and- development B2B relationships without the relevant absorptive capacity.

Bl systems use analytics and performance management concepts to leverage enterprise system databases and provide core management control system (MCS) capability. Our results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity (i.e., the ability to gather, absorb, and strategically leverage new external information) is critical to establishing appropriate technology infrastructure and to assimilating Bl systems for organizational benefit. Further, findings show that while top management plays a significant role in effective deployment of Bl systems, their impact is indirect and a function of operational managers' absorptive capacity. In particular, this indirect effect suggests that leveraging Bl systems is driven from the bottom up as opposed to the top down. This differentiates Bl from other isolated strategic MCS innovations that have traditionally been viewed as top-management driven."

Quart. 35(1) 128-152) have seen the proliferation of a vast literature citing the AC construct in over 10,000 published papers, chapters, and books, and interpreting it or applying it in many areas of organization science research, including organization theory, strategic management, and economics. However, with very few exceptions, the specific organizational routines and processes that constitute AC capabilities remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a routine-based model of AC as a first step toward the operationalization of the AC construct. Our intent is to direct attention to the importance of balancing internal knowledge creating processes with the identification, acquisition, and assimilation of new knowledge originating in the external environment. We decompose the construct of AC into two components, internal and external AC capabilities, and identify the configuration of metaroutines underlying these two components. These higher-level routines are expressed within organizations by configurations of empirically observable practiced routines that are idiosyncratic and firm specific. Therefore, we conceptualize metaroutines as the foundations of practiced routines. The ability of organizations to discover and implement complementarities between AC routines may explain why some firms are successful early adopters and most firms are imitators. Success as an early adopter of a new management practice or an innovation is expected to depend on the extent to which an organization evolves, adapts, and implements the configuration of its internal and external absorptive capacity routines. © 2011 INFORMS."

More precisely, AC mediates the relationship between organizational compatibility and innovation in a relational context. Data from two samples of 148 and 199 companies respectively that operate as strategic suppliers of two focal buyers, provide the base to empirically verify our hypotheses. Results grounded upon structural equations modelling offer strong support for the mediating role of AC between organizational compatibility and relational performance in terms of incremental and radical innovation.

A firm's absorptive link underscores that a firm's ability to develop new products stems from its prior knowledge in commercializing new applications of resources held by not only the firm, but also that of its alliance partners. Such a concept generated 6 testable hypotheses to which were mostly supported in this study's Poisson regression analysis of the biotechnology industry. This study concludes by offering three key contributions to product performance research."
"Key factors affecting acquisition of technological capabilities from foreign acquiring firms by small and medium sized local firms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953126429&doi=10.1016%2fj.jwb.2010.05.023&partnerID=40&md5=3c2e54a7fbff9f8ca21f96f5372b321c","The objectives of this study are to investigate whether foreign acquiring firms contribute towards enhancing technological capabilities of local firms in foreign markets. Given that drivers promoting technology acquisition from acquiring firms have been largely neglected in the literature, we attempt to identify the key factors influencing this phenomenon. Secondly, although several studies have discussed knowledge exchange through international acquisitions (IAs), little attention has been given to small and medium sized local acquired firms (SMLFs). By using three dimensions of organizational characteristics based on absorptive capacity, our empirical evidence reveals three key findings. First, to develop an effective absorptive capacity, mere exposure to favorable learning environments is not sufficient, and that intensity of effort is a critical component functioning as a facilitator towards the extent of learning. Second, what is already known can be improved when partners share similar business background. This is because the possession of relevant knowledge based on business relatedness increases the boundary of curriculum in organizations. Third, collaborative support from knowledge transferors is a significant catalyst generating a specific learning capability. © 2010."
"Effect of spillovers on foreign versus domestic industry leadership in a developing economy","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009415030&doi=10.5464%2fAMBPP.2011.142.a&partnerID=40&md5=d5d95761ec7a7bf5476fa43915cde1c2","An often contentious issue is how spillovers affect foreign versus domestic industry leadership in a developing economy, for instance, whether policies favour domestic firms. To address such issues it is important to understand the baseline effect of spillovers on industry leadership, which I focus on. I develop a formal model that compares the effect of different types of spillovers on industry leadership. I find that spillovers driven by absorptive capacity, versus by demonstration effects, are more likely contentious as: domestic leadership is higher; outcomes are more sensitive to host country policies; and the firm dynamics, such as entry and exit, due to the spillovers are harder to observe. Thus baseline expectations of which firms lead an industry depend on the types of spillovers."

Particularly in the automotive industry, companies tend to reduce the number of their suppliers and bundle them into hierarchical supplier pyramids characterised by low trust. However, establishing knowledge-transfer routines regarding production processes within the network can stabilise buyer-supplier cooperation and counterbalance the power embodied by the central buyer. Beside (1) inter-firm knowledge-sharing routines, this case study also analyses another potential source of inter-organisational competitive advantages: (2) partner-specific absorptive capacity. Both can form the basis for firms to loosen the classical supplier pyramids, to collaborate as partners and share mutual product development processes. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

However, it comes to the ""QUALITY"" of the provided knowledge by entities or systems. A high standard of knowledge implies the knowledge that is not stagnant and flows in the vessels of the organization and its circulation as well as application produces new knowledge. Therefore, in order to be prosperous and face the difficulties caused by market changes, a high standard of knowledge is required. In order to examine the interdependency of knowledge quality and innovation, dimensions and requirements of knowledge quality are elaborated. Data were reaped from questionnaire issued to SMEs inside industrial parks of Tehran city and descriptive statistics, frequency statistics as well as regression analysis were applied. It is demonstrated that Iranian SMEs have a moderate level of knowledge quality. Considering the characteristic of knowledge quality, the contextual knowledge quality showed a higher relevance to knowledge quality. Amongst the requirements of knowledge quality, absorptive capacity showed a stronger connection to knowledge quality. Moreover, results showed a strong relation between knowledge quality and innovation. Finally, accessibility knowledge quality as a new characteristic of knowledge quality and also the role of knowledge quality on non-financial organizational performance are suggested for future research. © 2011 International Business Information Management Association."

I argue that pro-market reforms augment firm profitability because they increase the competitiveness of local markets, allowing firms to increase their market experiential knowledge and ultimately their profitability. However, I also explain that the effects of reforms on firm profitability may be enhanced by the international strategic choices of firms because such choices may increase the potential for absorptive capacity and learning. I propose that developing-country firms that operate in international markets increase their market experiential knowledge by learning how to compete at international levels, which makes it easier to be competitive in their home market in response to reforms. This effect is especially pronounced for developing-country firms that establish subsidiaries in advanced economies, as it forces them to develop their market knowledge to the highest international levels. It is also stronger for firms that become multinationals before the start of pro-market reforms implementation because such firms have a head-start over other local firms by learning how to compete at international levels before the local market becomes more competitive. In short, I argue that the different aspects of a firm's internationalization that help increase its market experiential knowledge enhance the benefits of pro-market reforms on firm profitability because they make it easier for the firm to compete successfully in a market where such reforms are implemented. Using a panel of the largest 500 companies in Latin America from 1989-2008 and data from multiple sources, the analyses provide robust support for these arguments."

Specific research objectives were to better understand how organizational members learn and remember best practices and lessons learned; to assess the current state of collective learning within the organization using KM maturity models; to formulate research hypotheses as to how organizational learning (OL) could be improved and to identify critical enablers and obstacles to OL at the organization. The research team implemented three different pilot KM projects: an expertise finder, a project lessons learned database and an audiovisual storytelling website in order to better understand how tacit and explicit knowledge was created, shared, and used by organizational members. The ELS pilot is discussed here. The key findings showed that the organizational readiness for KM and OL were not present, that the organization lacked sufficient absorptive capacity to learn and that the organizational culture represented the greatest obstacle in blocking the organization's journey towards becoming a learning organization. While the organization was quite adept at leveraging tacit knowledge, they appeared to have greater difficulty when it came to documenting lessons learned and best practices and they did not appear to have an infrastructure in place that allowed for more formal knowledge sharing interactions. Longer term studies are rare in this field and yet OL is a process that requires a certain minimum amount of time before it becomes part and parcel of the way organizations become able to learn and to remember. The findings from this study provide a good blueprint to for all organizations that are or are thinking about embarking on the odyssey to become a learning organization. © Common Ground, Kimiz Dalkir."

A multiple case study of Brazilian subsidiaries of three multinational corporations using in-depth interviews, based on a conceptual model consisting of four propositions, was conducted to identify factors linked to the knowledge transfer process and to assess their influence on that transfer. The first proposition tries to assess explicit knowledge, primarily through the use of IT tools; the second analyzes the role of the subsidiary within the corporate network and how it influences the degree of knowledge sharing. The third assesses the influence of subsidiary absorptive capacity and the fourth analyzes the impact of worker exchange programs on knowledge sharing between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries. Study results confirm the four propositions and enable the identification of relationships between factors, especially explicit knowledge and worker expatriation as complementary factors in knowledge transfer strategies. © 2011 Brazilian Administration Review."

In particular, the issue is examined taking into account two main approaches on learning and knowledge creation: the exploration/exploitation model (March, 1991) and the model based on the concept of absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). These approaches are analyzed critically, with specific reference to inter-firm collaboration, taking into account also contributions within the so called Relational View (Gulati, 1998; Dyer and Singh, 1998; Kale and Singh, 1999, 2007; Kale, Dyer and Singh, 2002), according to which the social aspect of the relationship between the firm and its external environment is a central question. The basic assumption is that external relationships can generate knowledge and competences that are potentially able to generate relational rents (Dyer and Singh, 1998), important not only for the single firm but also for the whole aggregate (alliance, rather than network) it belongs to. Then a systemic logic comes out, according to which partners interact, exchange knowledge and resources, through different governance models, in order to reduce relational costs and gain the most intense synergic effects. The problem is, however, that such a profitable collaboration does not seem to be so widespread and in some cases networks fail because of the lack of coordination mechanisms. From this point of view, a governance entity can be necessary or at least appropriate (Kale, Dyer and Singh, 2002). Therefore, the aim of the paper is to verify: the role of relational knowledge within and between networks, in order to gain sustainable competitive advantage. In this direction, also the relationship between knowledge view and resource-based theory is analyzed, considering the former to complete and enrich the latter; if governance choices regarding relational knowledge can be themselves sources of competitive advantage."

This study shows that 1) the target's contributive capacity positively influences serendipitous value creation in postacquisition integration, and 2) the acquirer's absorptive capacity is not a constant or accumulative capacity, but rather relative and dependent on the characteristics of the target and the integration process, and 3) value is created through the interaction of the target's contributive and the acquirer's absorptive capacities."

R&D performance is also included in the theoretical model in order to generate further managerial implications. Instead of using conventional regression methods, structural equation modelling (SEM) is adopted to conduct path analysis, as SEM is well suited in verifying multiple-dependent models.

The reform process resulted in the integration of Vietnam into the world economy, which led to significant increase in foreign investment. By making use of panel data on 22 manufacturing industries over the period 1995-2005, this article examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI)-generated spillovers on manufacturing sector growth in Vietnam. Unlike most existing studies, which are limited to considering the effect of FDI on economic growth, this article focuses on the impact of FDI-linked spillovers that take place through both horizontal and vertical linkages between domestic and foreign firms. The empirical results presented here suggest that FDI-generated spillovers have made a significant contribution to manufacturing sector growth in Vietnam through vertical-backward linkages. The positive impact of vertical-backward linkages on manufacturing sector growth is strengthened by the stock of human capital. Specifically, manufacturing industries with a larger stock of human capital have experienced a higher level of technological advancement and hence stronger economic growth. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd."

However, performing the cooperative R&D and formation of spin-off companies has become an alternative route for technology transfer. With plenty of options by which public research institutes (PRI) can employ technology transfer, one should determine first the appropriate channel for the transfer in order to establish the appropriate strategy. This paper builds a theoretical framework to match the mode of technology transfer with two key conditions: (1) absorptive capacity of recipient firms and (2) dependence on complementary assets. The theoretical discussion elucidates that the combination of lower level of absorptive capacity and less dependence on complementary assets favor the creation of new firms as a mode of technology transfer; the opposite combination favors cooperative research and development (R&D), and the in-between case supports licensing as an appropriate mode of transfer. Based on the theoretical framework, we analyzed the case of chemical industry in Korea utilizing the concept of patent portfolio analysis."

This typology includes three models of implementation: ambidextrous, specialized, and diversified implementation. From an empirical perspective, the paper examines the performance consequences when applying these models, and compares their capacity to produce complementarities. Additionally, since firms' choices in matters of organizational search are viewed as endogenous variables, the paper examines the drivers affecting them and identifies the importance of firms' absorptive capacity and diversified technological opportunities in determining these choices.

Tacit knowledge is embodied in the minds of people, and is part and parcel of their skills. Since businesses concentrate on strategic tasks, many others are outsourced. This also applies to R&D. External knowledge sources help firms to leverage their internal R&D efforts. Internal and external knowledge have to be knitted together on the work floor giving rise to innovative products and processes. Since tacit knowledge is embodied in personnel, it is interesting to look at the role of the functions and the qualifications of R&D personnel in relation to activities developed in the framework of technical collaboration agreements. Using the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium, insights are offered in the way that external knowledge impacts on the organisation of the internal division of labour.

Located in the literature on small firm growth, we explore a corporate incident that threatened the survival of the firm under study. An analysis of the manner in which the firm's managers responded to this threat by developing and launching a new core business, without external intervention, forms the basis of the scholarly contribution of the case. It illustrates how a corporate incident can draw the attention of core shareholders to their need to address specific business and management issues and make subtle organizational changes that ensure the firm's survival under close control. © The Author(s) 2010."

To do this successfully, incumbents must learn to absorb and assimilate new knowledge, and undertake external boundary spanning search. Although previous studies have investigated these relationships, typically they have taken a macro perspective. In order to gain a better understanding of these relationships, this study is conducted at the firm-therapeutic level in a pharmaceutical industry setting. The results of this study show that incumbent firms that leverage their prior experience, develop absorptive capacity, and undertake external boundary spanning search are successful in adapting to the new technologies."

It finds that approaches to the strategic management of intellectual assets varies significantly according the size and type of KIBS firm. Differences in these approaches impact on the development of effective innovation processes, with resource deficiencies in smaller firms constraining their innovation capability. New technology-based KIBS firms are less likely than traditional professional service KIBS firms to have effective formalised learning systems in place, and generally operate within a more 'fluid' working environment. Measures of absorptive capacity indicate that firms perceive gaps in their ability to assimilate and apply knowledge which they recognise to be of strategic importance. The authors conclude that small KIBS firms face particular challenges in managing the innovation process and establishing sustainable knowledge management practices, and may benefit from targeted policy intervention. © 2011, IGI Global."

We argue that the controversy arises because, both theoretically and empirically, only a binary, open vs. closed, strategy has been considered. In this paper, we distinguish among three firm strategies: open, semi-open and closed, drawing upon a panel of Spanish firms (2004-2006) using data from Community Innovation Survey (CIS)-type surveys, and two different indicators of openness. Our results show that open innovators are smaller and less R&D intensive than semi-open ones, although larger and more R&D intensive than closed innovators. These results reduce some of the controversies, and show that two conflicting forces, absorptive capacity and a ""need"" effect, are at stake in open innovation strategies. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

There are scientists and schools, mainly representatives of liberal and neo- liberal approach, who advocate free economic run and implicitly free flow of capital. This point of view was on its highest in the middle of the twentieth century and proved to be proved to be dangerous and crisis- enhancing in the first decade of the twenty-first century. On the other hand, there are scientists and schools, representatives of Keynesian school, who provide more critical and more realistic approach (Blackamn, A., Wu, X., Razin, A., Sadka, E., Hausmann, R., Xan X.Vo and others). Pro- FDI scientists and policy makers have a number of arguments when praising foreign direct investment. They argue that incoming foreign capital ensures economic efficiency firstly, via new jobs created, secondly, via enabled technology transfer; thirdly, via encouraged competition in domestic markets; fourthly, via human capital development as foreigners engage (more) in employee training. One more argument is often used in favour of foreign direct investment, namely that FDI has an advantage over other investment forms (portfolio or loans) as it proved to be more resilient in times of economic crisis. On an empirical level, there is a body of evidence that suggests possible positive correlation between FDI and economic growth in developing countries. Yet, while much evidence indicates a one-way causality between FDI and growth, there are many indications that the causality may run both ways. Benefits brought by some foreign investment in one country it does not necessary mean that the same will happen in another one. Methods that gave some positive effects in North Africa might prove as unsuitable when investing in Eastern Europe. Increased competition may be beneficial for the host economy, or it may not. International corporations may push out national businesses if they are yet not able to compete. In that case many jobs might be lost instead of creating. Foreign flow of capital might spread good practices of corporate governance, accounting rules, and legal traditions, and it may also not. Incoming FDI can limit ability of local government to implement bad policies but it might also result in encouraging host government to implement bad policies and so to spread bad practices instead. According to the dependency school, in the long- run, FDI tends to impede economic growth and development of recipient economies. The evidence appears that FDI is favourable to economic welfare only if appropriate conditions exist in the host economy. This includes such factors as adequate absorptive capacity and human capital, a capacity of domestic businesses to face and hold out foreign competition, a capacity of local government to make rational and transparent decisions, abundance of projects and market gaps that cannot to be filled up by home producers etc. Thus it seems convenient to look deeper into the world practice by measuring the effects of FDI."

By proposing a conceptual outline for a general model that explains the relationship between technology management capability and new product development performance, we examine the impact of technology management capability on new product development performance, as well as the moderating effects of absorptive capacity on the relationship between technology management capability and new product development performance empirically. We argue that technology management capability can promote new product development performance more greatly with higher levels of absorptive capacity. We test this contention by making an empirical study based on a survey of 151 Chinese enterprises. The results show that technology management capability has a significantly positive impact on new product development performance, and absorptive capacity has a mediating effect on the relationship between technology management capability and new product development performance. These findings extend prior research by establishing the importance of the relationships among technology management capability, absorptive capacity, and new product development performance.

It further requires an evaluation of the readiness of the end-users and their ability to exploit these technologies to provide them with a competitive advantage in combat. The question is asked: ""Are the end users ready to absorb the new technology?"" and ""Are the end users able to exploit the new technology to achieve combat superiority?"" These questions were addressed through the evaluation of the absorptive capacity of the South African military at a particular point in time. Literature showed that the absorptive capacity construct was built on three dimensions: ability to evaluate new knowledge, ability to assimilate the knowledge and the ability to exploit the knowledge. These dimensions were subsequently expanded to four and formed the foundation for a new method of evaluating the absorptive capacity of the military.

Previous research indicates that there are a wide variety of motivations. These include the need to acquire valuable knowledge-based resources, to improve strategic flexibility, to experiment), to overcome organisational inertia, to mitigate risk and uncertainty, to reduce costs and development time in new product development, and the perception that the firm has the absorptive capacity to integrate acquisitions. In this paper we provide an in-depth literature review of the motivations for the acquisition of external technologies by firms. We find that these motivations can be broadly classed into four categories: (1) the development of technological capabilities, (2) the development of strategic options, (3) efficiency improvements, and (4) responses to the competitive environment. In light of this categorisation, we comment on how these different motivations connect to the wider issues of technology acquisition. © 2010 IEEE."

Special software for fuel identification and motor control is its main feature. Beginning in 2003, today already 23% of the Brazilian fleet and 95% of new cars have been built using this technology. Bosch was the pioneer in an early version in USA, in which it has been investing since the 80s. Bosch also made the earliest prototypes in Brazil (a GM car in 1994). But then Magnetti Marelli championed the architecture that is ultimately successful in the Brazilian Market: the so called software sensor technology. Bosch seems to have been reluctant in adopting the software sensor technology. Fixation in an early architecture, larger global and American market share and relatively smaller subsidiary in Brazil than Magneti Marelli are factors that seems relevant to explain this lagging behavior. This case research shows the importance of absorptive capacity and other competition factors on determining a dominant design for flex-fuel injection systems. © 2010 IEEE."

Using a dataset from survey and archival sources on 100 innovations by R&D project teams, we find that the capability of R&D team members to evaluate external knowledge is related to their ability to assimilate it and that both individual assimilation capabilities and collective assimilation capabilities, in the form of ability to reach a shared understanding, are important to the teams ability to apply external knowledge. We also find that prior knowledge negatively moderates the relationship between individual assimilation and application ability and that team autonomy positively moderates this relationship. By clarifying levels of analysis and encompassing multiple dimensions of ACAP, this work leads to a more fine-grained understanding of the complex nature of ACAP. Implications of these findings for future research and R&D team management are presented. © 2006 IEEE."

However, a critical question is: Can strategic assets be effectively acquired by Chinese firms, thereby leading to superior firm performance? This article addresses this fundamental question from an absorptive capacity perspective. This approach concentrates on how an acquiring firm's absorptive capacity influences its ability to identify, assimilate, integrate, and apply external new knowledge into commercial use. By comparatively examining two high-profile international M&A deals completed by leading Chinese firms Lenovo and TCL, we argue that the performance of Chinese companies' overseas acquisitions is substantially affected by the acquiring firm's absorptive capacity at multiple dimensions, thus drawing strategic implications for multinationals in other emerging markets. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

However, this process is fraught with challenges and risks, given the degree of uncertainty regarding future returns. In an attempt to minimise such risks, the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) process has been developed within University Science Park Incubators (USIs) to test the technological, business and market potential of embryonic technology. The key or the pivotal stakeholder within the PoC is the Principal Investigator (PI), who is usually the lead academic responsible for the embryonic technology. Within the current literature, there appears to be a lack of research pertaining to the role of the PI in the PoC process. Moreover, Absorptive Capacity (ACAP) has emerged within the literature as a theoretical framework or lens for exploring the development and application of new knowledge and technology, where the USI is the organisation considered in the current study. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the role and influence of the PI in the PoC process within a USI setting using an ACAP perspective. The research involved a multiple case analysis of PoC applications within a UK university USI. The results demonstrate the role of the PI in developing practices and routines within the PoC process. These practices and processes were initially tacit and informal in nature but became more explicit and formal over time so that knowledge was retained within the USI after the PIs had completed the PoC process. © 2010 The Authors.

The term 'strategic space' refers to the process by which owner-managers are able to access resources, motivation and capability to review existing practices. The starting point is the owner-manager's human capital and their capacity to engage in critical reflection about their business. We highlight three concepts central to the creation of strategic space, first, social capital, which refers to the network relationships that provide access to a wide range of resources and information. Second, absorptive capacity, which describes the way in which organizational members identify, acquire and utilize knowledge from external sources. Third, mediating artefacts, which represent existing knowledge but also facilitate the translation and transformation of understanding within and between communities of practice. This process is essential to the renewal of knowledge and knowing within firms. The contribution this paper makes is to bring together these elements - human and social capital, absorptive capacity and mediating artefacts - to offer a conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism by which owner-managers create strategic space. This model provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of knowledge in smaller organizations. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

Firms form TJVs in an effort to access future technological opportunities without losing flexibility in uncertain contexts. The real options approach allows the essence of such managerial thinking to be captured, although research in this line remains scarce. Drawing on the real options approach and using an eight-year panel of 4050 Spanish manufacturing firms, we examine under which conditions firms form technological joint ventures. We find that a firm's propensity to form technological joint ventures is positively related to its absorptive capacity and to the degree of environmental technological uncertainty, and negatively related to the risk of pre-emption by rivals and the existence of opportunity costs. Our study contributes to bridging the gap between finance theory and strategic analysis. In addition, it shows practitioners the applicability of the real options approach for decision-making. Results suggest that public policies should particularly, although not exclusively, foster participation of young and small firms in technological joint ventures. We also suggest using managerial perceptions as a guide for channeling public grants. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Few studies consider their joint influence and even fewer consider the temporal change of those effects on firm valuation. In this study, we propose that firm age, a key organizational variable, represents both the development of organizational routines from a start-up's perspective and the accumulation of accessible information from an investor's viewpoint. As such, an investor's evaluation of a high technology start-up's innovative capability and inter-firm network evolves with firm age. Using panel data of 170 biotechnology start-ups, our results suggest that the relative value of network status declines while the impact of innovative capability increases with firm age. Interestingly, there is a growing complementary effect of innovative capability and network heterogeneity on firm valuation. The implications of these findings for entrepreneurial practice and theories of firm capabilities and inter-firm network are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc."

The Taiwan telecommunications industry has prospered, currently occupying key positions in global markets even though NTP seldom contributes positively to patent citation performance. Hence, the authors of this study investigate the qualitative perspective of intellectual capital rather than quantitative technological indices. The current study focuses on both human capital and relational assets through surveys of 53 principal investigators of NTP projects and 63 industrial R&D managers of telecommunications corporations in the Taiwan market. Results show that NSTP member quality and the flow of employment are good indicators of human capital and that both perform better than the middle value in the case of Taiwan NTP. In addition, we find that industrial participants are more likely to share R&D resources than other academic researchers with higher intention of co-publishing, co-funding, and sharing equipments and facilities. The industrial NTP participants also have higher expectations regarding achieving advanced technology breakthroughs in contrast to non-NTP industrial interviewees. Moreover, industrial participants with greater industry-university cooperation intensity indeed obtain a particular advantage, that is, greater knowledge acquisition from other fields related to the effect of knowledge spillovers through the particular NSTP linkage. Accordingly, from the perspectives of human capital and relational assets, the authors conclude by articulating the importance of absorptive capacity resulting from good human capital and knowledge spillover contributed by relational assets within governmental technology policy and NSTP programming. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

This case study applies the theory of absorptive capacity to ASUSTek Computer Inc., a small Taiwanese business founded on April 2, 1990 by four engineers with capital of NT$30 million (US$950,000) which has grown to become a global leader in the IT industry with a total revenue of NT$755 billion (US$24 billion) and market capitalization of NT$49 billion (US$1.5 billion) as of December 31, 2007. (Based on exchange rate US$1 NT$31.5. ASUS's revenue dropped to NT$668 billion in 2008 mainly due to the global financial crisis.) ASUS' business significantly took off after Jonney Shih joined the company as CEO in 1993. He remains a key anchor of ASUS. ASUS' ability to not only absorb, transform, and utilize new knowledge but develop new technology in-house to create and sustain competitive advantage in the market place has ensured the company's continuing success as well as propelling it to a position of leadership in the IT industry worldwide. This paper will discuss how ASUS' in-house RandD; apprenticeship-style on-the-job training; management leadership's organizational culture and structure-all of which stress learning and innovation; financial resources and conservative fiscal policy; as well as pro-business government policies have provided the foundation and environment for great absorptive capacity to develop and adapt technology, enabling ASUS to become a ""Giant Lion"" in the global computer industry. © 2010 Institute of East and West Studies."

We contribute to the literature on cooperation in innovation activities that seeks to identify the characteristics differentiating cooperative from non-cooperative firms by proposing a different approach to this problem. We distinguish firms according to their evaluation of cooperation partners in the development of innovation activities. We apply a probit selection model to account for the firm's decision to cooperate (or not). The data we use come from the Portuguese Third Community Innovation Survey. Our estimation results show that firms from high-technological industries, with higher levels of absorptive capacity and of innovation investment, who give importance to incoming spillovers management, and who cooperate with firms from the same group or with suppliers, place greater value on cooperation partners in the innovation process. Additionally, we also find that the factors influencing the importance attributed to cooperation activities are different from the ones behind the decision to cooperate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Do leading or lagging firms learn more from exporting?","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956923232&doi=10.1002%2fsmj.850&partnerID=40&md5=e0f800d6170c4751b28003180d809e9a","An interesting theoretical debate arises when considering firm heterogeneity in learning from exporting. One perspective intimates that technologically lagging firms stand to benefit more from exporting because exposure to technological knowledge in foreign markets allows these firms to close the gap with their more technologically endowed counterparts. A contrasting perspective posits that technologically superior firms benefit more from exporting since these firms are better equipped to translate knowledge acquired in foreign markets into innovation. Using a sample of 1,744 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990-1997, this study empirically investigates how exporting differentially influences the patent output of technologically leading versus technologically lagging firms. We find that exporting is associated with the ex post increase in innovative productivity for both technologically leading and lagging firms. However, subsequent to exporting, technologically leading firms apply for more patents than technologically lagging firms. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Over a 3-year post-acquisition window, our sample of 2624 high technology US acquisitions records early reverses followed by positive R&D-intensity changes and insignificant R&D productivity changes. Controlling for acquisition endogeneity and deal-specific effects, significant acquirer characteristic effects emerge. In related acquisitions, a large knowledge base tends to increase R&D productivity, consistent with an enhanced capacity to select and absorb targets. In unrelated acquisitions, however, this relationship becomes increasingly negative as knowledge base concentration increases, consistent with arguments for an impaired peripheral vision and core rigidities. High leverage levels raise R&D productivity gains, consistent with enhanced monitoring induced efficiency. However, high leverage growth reduces R&D-intensity, consistent with increased financial constraints and short-termism. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We predicted that absorptive capacity would moderate tacit knowledge relationships with team performance, and that transactive memory would moderate explicit knowledge relationships with team performance. We found that the patterns of relationships differed depending on the measure of team performance. The predictions held for absorptive capacity by tacit knowledge on manager-assessed performance, and for transactive memory by explicit knowledge on customer satisfaction. Additionally, there was a significant direct effect, with no moderation, of tacit knowledge on customer satisfaction.

The paper also investigates the effect of FDI spillovers on domestic firms in Ghana. The results indicate that firms with high proportion of foreign capital are more productive than those with low or no foreign capital. This could be attributed to the fact that, firms with more foreign capital injection are in a better position to employ advanced forms of technology, employ managers with better international exposure and skills in modern management techniques, adopt good corporate governance and management practices, and may have better access to credit from the international financial markets. We find no significant effect of spillovers from FDI on the productivity of domestic firms. Spillovers from FDI may not be high enough to warrant any significant effect on the productivity of domestic firms. It is also likely that the absorptive capacity of domestic firms in Ghana is not strong enough to generate positive spillovers from FDI.

Design/methodology/approach - Constructs were developed through a comprehensive literature review. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research model and hypotheses based on a large sample of 303 US manufacturing firms. Findings - Both MBMP and MSI have significant impacts on MP. The positive effects of MBMP on MP are stronger than those of system integration. The absorptive capacity of a firm facilitates better use of modularity practices and system integration. Practical implications - More attention should be given to modularity practices in resource allocation planning. Also, system integration together with modularity practices can generate significantly higher MP. Originality/value - The paper is the first large-scale empirical study to examine the effects of absorptive capacity on MSI and MBMP, which in turn impacts MP. Furthermore, the findings empirically support that a combination strategy of modularity and system integration can help manufacturing firms to achieve higher performance. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

However, little is known about which antecedents of absorptive capacity are important in strategic alliances that have either an 'exploitation' or 'exploration' purpose. This paper contributes to understanding of this issue by developing a typology of different antecedents of absorptive capacity with respect to their relative importance in exploitation and exploration type alliances and by deriving testable propositions. Examining alliances of a software company specialising in decision management solutions provides initial case study evidence for the propositions. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

In this study, we advance the literature by examining the effect of the diversity of FDI country origins on the productivity of domestic firms. We propose that the diversity of FDI country origins can facilitate FDI spillovers by increasing the variety of technologies and management practices brought by foreign firms, to which domestic firms are exposed and that they can potentially utilize. Further, the extent to which domestic firms can utilize these technologies and practices depends upon their absorptive capacity. Using panel data on Chinese manufacturing firms during the period 1998-2003, our results support these propositions. We find that the diversity of FDI country origins in an industry has a positive relationship with the productivity of domestic firms in the industry. This positive relationship is stronger when domestic firms are larger, and when the technology gap between FDI and the domestic firms is intermediate. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This learning process refers to the transfer of knowledge from the IBA to the focal firm. Results indicate that while learning effectiveness positively influences the RBLC of the focal firm, learning efficiency has a negative impact on RBLC. The IBA's home country network centrality and the tie strength between the focal organization and the IBA are found to influence learning effectiveness positively. Tie strength also enhances learning efficiency. Finally, the findings indicate that the IBA's home country network centrality enhances the strength of the ties between the focal organization and its IBA. © 2010 Elsevier Inc."

Given that the acquisition process is plagued by serious issues of information asymmetry, which are exacerbated in the context of knowledge acquisitions, we examine whether prior alliances with potential targets reduce the information asymmetry enough to create ""partner-specific absorptive capacity"" and yield superior stock returns on acquisition, compared with acquisitions not preceded by alliances. We test our hypotheses on a sample of high-technology acquisitions by U.S. firms during 1990-1998 using an event study methodology to assess abnormal stock returns. We find, unexpectedly, that no significant general effect emerges for acquisitions with prior alliances. However, international acquisitions following alliances show significantly better returns relative to both acquisitions without prior alliances and domestic acquisitions. Additionally, stronger forms of prior alliances lead to better acquisition performance than weaker forms of alliances. Together, the results broadly support our thesis that partner-specific absorptive capacity may be at work and suggest that under certain prior alliance conditions, acquisitions can indeed create value for acquirers. © 2010 INFORMS."

It looks at the innovation dynamics and their related knowledge processes, needed to leverage one's intellectual capital. It also explores the fact that many organizations are reliant on the knowledge and the competence of individual organizational members. Consequently, information systems to support knowledge management (KM) are considered to be vital tools in order to achieve competitive advantage. In this paper, we discuss the role of innovation processes and network dynamics, in terms of integrated knowledge networks, which offer viable options for leveraging innovation both as an interactive process, and knowledge processes for creating BI. This is due in part, because, they encompass a number of organizations, people and resources and the relationships between them. Integrated knowledge networks are supported by an architecture that combines organizational and technological elements, that is the innovation processes and network dynamics. This allows for the design of an information system that supports the innovation process, in terms of its diversity, absorptive capacity, and social relations.

A literature search guided by the theoretical framework, and evidence from two case studies, were used to address the objective of the study. Findings The study elicited the organizational routines that influence the three knowledge management processes.

In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of absorptive capacity. Given the size and diversity of the absorptive capacity literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the absorptive capacity literature; and (3) the emergence of absorptive capacity from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational, and interorganizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of absorptive capacity as well as the contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity.

This paper combines both approaches to test for the relative importance of each type of factor using firm-level data on large Australian companies from 1990 to 2005. Our evidence suggests that most of a firm's R&D activity can be explained by time-invariant factors which we believe relate to internal and specific characteristics such as the firm's managerial dimensions, competitive strategy and how it communicates with employees. Of the remaining time-varying portion, we find that past profits, the rate of growth of the industry and the level of R&D activity over the firm's industry is pertinent.

Combining the innovation literature with the latecomer literature on 'catch-up' strategies of firms in newly industrialized economies, we posit that access to foreign knowledge is essential for fostering product innovation. In particular, we investigate how innovation clusters formed by inward foreign direct investments in an emerging market and export activities of a firm are effective channels for acquiring foreign knowledge. We also suggest firms that invest in research and development and marketing activities benefit further from access to foreign knowledge due to increased absorptive capacity. Empirically, we employ information on over 160,000 indigenous manufacturing firms in China in 2005-2006. We find strong empirical support for our theoretical framework and conclude by discussing the implications for both theory and managerial practice. © 2010 The International Association for Chinese Management Research."

For many, global acquisitions have proven to be highly problematic and valuedestroying. The purpose of this paper is to address this critical acquisition failure issue from an absorptive capacity perspective. Design/methodology/approach Guided by the framework that focuses on how acquiring a firm's weak absorptive capacity damages its ability to assimilate, integrate and apply external new knowledge, one highprofile Chinese failed acquisition: TCL acquisition of France's Thomson's TV business in 2004 is analyzed empirically. Findings Acquisition performance of Chinese overseas M&A is found to be substantially affected by the acquiring firm's absorptive capacity at multiple dimensions. Research limitations/implications – The absorptive capacity construct provides an insightful account for differentials in Chinese overseas M&A performance. Practical implications For decision makers interested in formulating and implementing overseas M&A strategy, appropriate evaluation of their own firms’ absorptive capability should be the first step to take. Originality/value –This is the first paper to apply absorptive capacity arguments to Chinese resourcedriven M&A strategy, and will prompt business academicians and practitioners to think about M&A strategy in new and innovative ways. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

The relationship between factors of influencing knowledge transfer and knowledge transfer performance is discussed with the methods of theoretical and quantitative analysis. The results show that the knowledge transfer among supply chain members can be divided into three levels, including between supply chain and external environment, between members of supply chain, and organization's internal knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer performance among supply chain members is affected by knowledge characteristics, communication and trust degree among supply chain members, supply chain members' knowledge absorptive capacity, knowledge transfer channels' richness and knowledge transfer cost. An undirected weighted small-world network model can be used to evaluate the knowledge transfer performance among supply chain members. ©2010 IEEE."

On the one hand, business units that employ similar technological knowledge have better absorptive capacity to source knowledge from each other. On the other hand, a higher level of technological relatedness means that each business unit possesses fewer opportunities to gain new knowledge not known to other units, thus promoting path dependence to each other.

We use balanced panel data on 46 pharmaceutical firms in Japan for the period 1992-2005. Then, we introduce a new concept, propensity to capture basic research (PCBR), to index how much scientific knowledge firms have assimilated from universities and public research institutes. We use this index to verify whether absorption of such knowledge influences corporate performance. According to econometric analysis, PCBR is positively significant for patent applications and patent efficiency but not for number of approved drugs. This obviously implies that scientific knowledge assimilated from academia is effective for technological performance in firms.

It also fills in a gap in the existing literature by examining the internal drivers within the firm that impact absorptive capacity, arguing that two of the dimensions of organizational culture, task-orientation and risk-orientation, are negatively related to absorptive capacity and that three other dimensions-open communication, collective rewards, and cooperative culture-positively affect absorptive capacity. Partial least squares technique is used to analyze the data, which are collected by administering a survey to 375 business unit heads/managers. The results significantly support all the hypotheses of the inner path model; however, the structural model shows small to moderate effect sizes.

This relationship is examined in a variety of ways, and it is suggested that the literature on these two concepts shares a conceptual affinity which needs to be delineated. It is suggested that absorptive capacity (a dynamic capability) is a concrete example of organizational learning that concerns an organization's relationship with new external knowledge.

Knowledge relatedness has typically been equated with knowledge similarity and the separate influence of knowledge complementarity has been overlooked. Similarly, studies examining innovation outcomes of M&As have typically focused on the role of technological knowledge and overlooked the influence of scientific knowledge. We develop a model of relatedness and invention performance of high-technology M&As that considers science and technology similarity and complementarity as important drivers of invention. We test the model using a sample of M&As from the drug, chemical, and electronics industries and a fine-grained measure of knowledge relatedness that distinguishes between science and technology relatedness. We find that complementary scientific knowledge and complementary technological knowledge both contribute to post-merger invention performance by stimulating higher quality and more novel inventions. This suggests that high-technology firms seeking acquisitions should search for, identify, and acquire businesses that have scientific and technological knowledge that is complementary to their own. Our results also suggest that similarities in knowledge facilitate incremental renewal, while complementarities would make discontinuous strategic transformations more likely, and that absorptive capacity research should be expanded to consider complementarities as well as similarities.

The proposed framework expands the interpartner learning theory of IJV instability in the current literature, which is focused on absorptive learning of IJV partners, by incorporating IJV partners joint learning. Using longitudinal dyadic data from IJVs in China, we found that local and foreign IJV parties absorptive learning capacity decreases one party's dependence on the other, while joint learning capacity in IJV increases both parties dependence on each other. In addition, an IJV partner's absorptive learning capacity positively moderates the effect of joint learning capacity on its dependence on another partner. These findings lend support to the expanded interpartner learning perspective of IJV instability, and have important theoretical and managerial implications for IJVs in emerging economies. The results underscore the importance of the IJV actively developing organizational rules, procedures, and structures to create and embed new knowledge in order to maintain the stability of the IJV. Finally, we found that IJV partners dependence asymmetry increases IJV instability, whereas their total dependence decreases IJV instability. © 2010 Academy of International Business All rights reserved."

I introduce a conceptual framework to examine how specialization, learning ('absorptive capacity') and innovation enhance the potential for industrial upgrading. Finding the right balance between firm-level and industry-level upgrading and between domestic and international elements is a moving target and requires permanent adjustments to changes in markets and technology. Three findings distinguish this paper from prior work. First, absorptive capacity is critical for Taiwan's attempts to upgrade its IT industry through innovation. Second, Taiwanese firms now must increase R&D to avoid diminishing returns of network integration. Third, integration into diverse networks of production and innovation may well provide new lower-cost opportunities for 'industrial upgrading through innovation'. 'Technology diversification', which combines incremental and architectural innovations, can serve as a complementary and arguably less costly option to 'technology leadership' strategies. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

Building on the absorptive capacity perspective and organizational inertia theory, the authors propose that technological capability has curvilinear and differential effects on exploitative and explorative innovations. The findings support the proposition that though technological capability fosters exploitation at an accelerating rate, it has an inverted U-shaped relationship with exploration. That is, a high level of technological capability impedes explorative innovation. Strategic flexibility strengthens the positive effects of technological capability on exploration, such that when strategic flexibility is high, greater technological capability is associated with more explorative innovation.

Thai intellectual property regime was, until the early 1990s, characterized by weak protection and yet it was not pro-diffusion either. That is, it was not particularly favorable to catch-up and the lack of preconditions did not help either, for instance, the absence of sufficient indigenous absorptive capacity of firms, the lack of mechanisms or coordinated policy for knowledge diffusion and utilization, and the environment in general not being favorable to innovation. © Oxford University Press, 2013."

In particular, we conceptually argue and empirically confirm the links between learning intent, capability enhancement, governance mode, and overall innovativeness from the perspective of local suppliers in offshore OEM cooperation in China as well as the influence of local business culture within these links. We address two issues: (1) offshore OEM cooperation can be a unique opportunity for local suppliers with strong intent to learn from foreign buyers for capability enhancement and (2) the moderating effects of trust and contact as two distinctive governance modes. Addressing the two issues, we make two specific contributions to the research on inter-firm cooperation, both of which derive from the often-neglected theoretical lens of transaction value. Our general contribution lies in the extension of the transaction value perspective by specifying its dual tenets of inter-firm co-specialization and shared-trust as the central theme of inter-firm cooperation to complement the transaction cost economics and also contextualize the research on inter-firm cooperation in terms of different partners' perspectives as well as different governance modes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the concept of absorptive capacity to analyze what role the uptake and integration of external knowledge plays in implementing an environmental strategy and propose to make a distinction between shared and unit-specific levels of absorptive capacity. Based on an in-depth investigation of the multinational chemical company BASF, we derive three propositions about the influence of absorptive capacity on the implementation of global environmental practices on the regional headquarters and subsidiary level. The main finding is that a shared level of absorptive capacity across subsidiaries facilitates a common understanding and use of environment-related knowledge, but, as environment-related knowledge often applies to a specific context only, there is also a need to build unit-specific absorptive capacity on a subsidiary level. By allowing subsidiaries to build their absorptive capacity, MNCs can more efficiently adapt global environmental practices and lower the cost of implementing a global environmental standard. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: Starting from the analysis of the literature, the paper has introduced a theoretical model that has been illustrated analyzing the Iranian case. Findings: Governments can promote the realisation of knowledge spillovers only if they create the conditions for improving the absorptive capacity of local firms and the connections between local firms and foreign investors (strategic approach). Moreover, in many emerging countries, governments are directly involved in relationships with foreign investors through state-owned companies. According to this, the Iranian case shows how the direct government involvement, if it is matched with a strategic approach, can encourage the realization of FDI knowledge spillovers. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents some limitations: other quadrants of the proposed model need to be further explored adopting other case studies; moreover, the Iranian case can be examined more in deep. Practical implications: From a policymaker's point of view, the paper is an useful tool because it gives them many suggestions about what FDIs attraction policies have to be adopted in order to realize FDI knowledge spillovers. Originality/value: From a theoretical point of view, the paper gives a contribution to the literature on FDI spillovers highlighting the direct relationships between host government policies and FDI knowledge spillovers, especially revaluing the opportunities stemming from a direct government intervention.

For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has; however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of ""absorptive capacity"" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The theoretical foundation that supports the choice of managing change as projects and, in effect, the role of project management has received surprisingly little attention in the current literature. In this paper, we present a model where the success of change initiatives is explained by the quality of project management, which in turn is determined by the quality of knowledge integration. The outlined model highlights knowledge integration as a process determined by the scope and speed of change, which typically result in problems with synchronization of activities within an LST project. Our model draws on the idea of 'knowledge entrainment' to explain the fact that different parts (organizations, teams, individuals) tend to develop different time orientations and hence rely on different cycles of knowledge processes. This has important effects on the absorptive capacity of the involved parts of the project and the amount of information and knowledge that the project can digest. This paper discusses different knowledge-entrainment mechanisms and their effects on the role and practice of project management. Empirical data from an LST project in Posten, one of the Northern Europe's largest messaging and logistics operators, illustrate the model. The paper contributes to the analysis of the relationships between knowledge integration and time, particularly in LST projects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA."
"A model of rapid knowledge development: The smaller born-global firm","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-74849086559&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibusrev.2009.09.004&partnerID=40&md5=b183407b13c61246409a5d835fc6b41c","Existing models of the internationalization process have not captured the important phenomenon of accelerated international growth of born-global firms, which led Johanson and Vahlne (2003) to revise their model. However, the revised network model falls short of explaining rapid internationalization of firms. While they indicate a ""specific relationship development process"" used by born-global managers, Johanson and Vahlne (2003) still suggest the existence of an incremental learning and ""responsive"" model, which is based on pre-existing relationships. We extend current theory in arguing that born-global managers can use both pre-existing and newly formed relationships, to quickly and proactively develop new knowledge for rapid commercialization of their products. Proactive, advanced relationship-building capability is based around locating partners with technological knowledge with a view to ensuring ease of sharing knowledge. We explore the development of trust and inter-firm partnerships in established and newly formed networks and how these lead to tacit knowledge, absorptive capacity and new knowledge generation. While Johanson and Vahlne (2003) emphasize ""market specific experience and operation experience"" we emphasize ""technological experience"". The reason that knowledge sharing is able to proceed quickly is that the shared ""technological knowledge"" allows rapid transfer and development of new knowledge and the drive to commercialize a product before a competitor, promotes the ""mutual need"" (co-dependency) to act quickly, characteristic of technology-based industries, which face rapid change. As an outcome of the born-global manager's ability to locate new partners through existing networks, new international links may be quickly developed, with internationalization being an outcome, but not necessarily a driver of behaviour in smaller born-global supply chains.

"Conflict-coordination learning in marketing channel relationships: The distributor view","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-75749108603&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2008.10.003&partnerID=40&md5=e9e1141e66d8db540e94aa2bcf50824e","Although a fairly large body of literature exists on channel conflict management, little research has been done from an interorganizational conflict-learning perspective. This study explores how channel members can use conflict-coordination learning (CCL), as a conflict resolution mechanism, which leads to improved capabilities, which in turn can enhance co-created value in marketing channel relationships from a distributor point of view. Drawing on both a resource-based view of the firm, an absorptive capacity perspective, and an interorganizational learning approach, we propose that conflict values (positive conflict attitudes and avoidance of conflict behaviors) can be viewed as firm resources that directly influence CCL, which in turn can enhance co-created value (joint marketing strategy quality and joint profit performance). To explore these issues, we developed and tested our hypotheses with data from 101 distributors within the food industry in Taiwan. As predicted, we find that positive conflict attitudes are positively related to CCL, and that avoidance of conflict behaviors is negatively related to CCL. Furthermore, the results indicate that joint marketing strategy quality mediates the relationship between CCL and joint profit performance. Specifically, under high positive conflict attitudes, CCL strongly appears related to joint marketing strategy quality. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Absorptive capacity provides an alternative way of theorizing the relationships between organizational performance and knowledge processes, derived from the resource-based view of the firm and the broader concept of dynamic capabilities. The article reviews the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological implications of applying absorptive capacity to the performance of public organizations. It concludes that the approach has value and presents a number of propositions to be tested through empirical study, alongside some more general challenges for researchers who wish to study the concept further.

Using data from the German innovation survey, we investigate how firms are able to exploit knowledge from external partners for successful innovation activities. The estimation results show that the determinants of absorptive capacity differ with respect to the type of knowledge absorbed for innovation activities. In particular, we find that the R&D intensity does not significantly influence absorptive capacity for intra- and inter-industry knowledge. Additionally, our results suggest that absorptive capacity is path dependent and firms can influence their ability to exploit external knowledge by encouraging individuals' involvement in a firm's innovation projects. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

However, there is a lack of critical reviews covering both theory and practice. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to critically review the literature of Six Sigma using a consistent theoretical perspective, namely absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach- The literature from peer-reviewed journals has been critically reviewed using the absorptive capacity framework and dimensions of acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. Findings- There is evidence of emerging theoretical underpinning in relation to Six Sigma borrowing from an eclectic range of organisational theories. However, this theoretical development lags behind practice in the area. The development of Six Sigma in practice is expanding mainly through more rigorous studies and applications in service-based environments (profit and not for profit). The absorptive capacity framework is found to be a useful overarching framework within which to situate existing theoretical and practice studies. Research limitations/implications- Agendas for further research from the critical review, in relation to both theory and practice, have been established in relation to each dimension of the absorptive capacity framework. Practical implications- The paper shows that Six Sigma is both a strategic and operational issue and that focussing solely on define, measure, analyse, improve control-based projects can limit the strategic effectiveness of the approach within organisations. Originality/value- Despite the increasing volume of Six Sigma literature and organisational applications, there is a paucity of critical reviews which cover both theory and practice and which suggest research agendas derived from such reviews. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We will draw on research that we have been undertaking on organisations in the public sector, examining how they respond to evidence that they are performing poorly and what part absorptive capacity plays in determining their response. Introduction Organisations in the public sector are subject to increased monitoring and management of their performance. Schools, hospitals, local authorities, police forces and other public service agencies are required to meet nationally set performance standards and targets and their performance is often publicly reported through league tables, performance indicators, and reports from inspectorates and regulators. While those organisations that are deemed to be high performing may be rewarded, for example, by way of greater freedoms, those whose performance is poor are expected to bring about substantial, and often rapid, improvements in performance. Organisations appear to react to evidence of poor performance in a range of both defensive and proactive ways, some challenging the measures against which they have been judged, others seeking ways to respond to the evidence and bring about the necessary improvements. © Cambridge University Press 2010."

Therefore, they need to carefully develop abilities to absorb knowledge from outside the firm's boundaries so as to have access to cutting-edge knowledge in spite of limited resources. One strategy is to establish knowledge management (KM) projects for this purpose. In this paper, we describe how KM projects and subsequently emerging KM routines in SMEs facilitate the enhancement of the firm's absorptive capacity (AC; i.e., the ability to recognize, capture, and assimilate external knowledge). Our results indicate the importance of recognizing potential knowledge providers prior to any absorption of knowledge from external sources. Furthermore, we emphasize the relevance of routines for absorbing knowledge and we distinguish between KM routines that are deliberately developed for absorbing knowledge and KM projects where knowledge absorption happens unconsciously. Finally, we point out that different stages of an AC process follow different logics (exploration vs. exploitation) and, thus, a skilful management of the AC cycle is necessary to leverage externally absorbed knowledge. © 2010 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire data were collected from research and development (R&D) managers or owners of 49 SMEs of the bicycle industry in Taiwan. The questionnaire was designed to measure variables including: knowledge absorptive capacity, knowledge acquisition of company, technical and industrial experiences of owner's and the R&D staff, innovation performance measures, and control variables. Findings - The results show that the depth and the breadth of its owner's technical and industrial experiences best explained absorptive capacity of an SME. In turn, the absorptive capacity and the knowledge acquisition activities of an SME affect its innovation performance. Research limitations/implications - The findings show that, first, SME owners' technical and industrial experiences are contributing factors to their companies' knowledge absorptive capacity; second, instead of R&D investment, SME personnel's scientific knowledge collection and diversity of knowledge sources contribute to innovation performance of companies. Because the data were limited to bicycle industry, future studies need to validate these findings in the SMEs of other industries. Originality/value - The value of the paper lies in the fact that SME owner's and its personnel's contributions to company's knowledge absorptive capacity and the concomitant effects of knowledge acquisition and knowledge absorption capacity on a firm's innovation performance are two issues seldom addressed in previous studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach - The present case study deals with three companies with subsidiaries in Mozambique which develop activities in the industrial sector, where the procedures of the analysis of contents are applied in order to answer the research questions. Findings - The results show that the transferred knowledge must be directed at the operational needs felt locally. It must be avoided that the receiver believes the transferred knowledge is imposed by the transmitter, in order for it to be used as an asset in the production of new products, but without reproducing the MNE headquarters' business model because of the specific local context.

The paper critiques the method used by KMS researchers whereby co-variation of KMS and competitiveness is utilized to study the relationship between these variables. The model proposed here is a multi-stage process. The successful use of KMS generates intermediate outcomes that in turn impact the organization and produces improved strategic competitiveness. The different approaches to KMS and the stage-process allow for the unique attributes of knowledge systems, different from information systems.

Then the two groups are examined to identify the main factors classifying the groups by using logistic regression. This study finds that managerial knowledge that has more sticky characteristics than technology is acquirable know-how. It also shows that trust between parents, international experience of IJV employees, and foreign parent's support in various managerial functions will considerably increase the extent of knowledge acquisition for IJVs.

However, despite the plethora of publications, conferences, and strategies that deal with sustainability, tourism is arguably less sustainable than it has ever been. The reasons for this are several-fold and include the relative weakness of sustainability research in tourism as an epistemic community; economic, institutional and political barriers; and the inherent problems of the concept in terms of its capacity to marry social, environmental and economic indicators, and the addiction to economic growth. Following an outline of the expansion of tourism’s contribution to global environmental change the article provides a re-conceptualization of sustainable tourism from an ecological economics perspective. From this approach sustainable tourism development is understood as tourism development without growth in throughput of matter and energy beyond regenerative and absorptive capacities. Steady-state tourism is, therefore, a tourism system that encourages qualitative development but not aggregate quantitative growth to the detriment of natural capital. In the case of tourism, more does not mean better, and growth does not mean development. Tourism policy implications are also examined. It is concluded that while the political-economic indications for such a transformative approach are not immediately encouraging, the environmental necessity is stronger than ever. © 2010 Tourism Recreation Research."

Building on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view, I argue that, because JVs often involve incomplete contracts, differences in wealth gains arise due to resource appropriation and private benefits. As a result, two factors become important in understanding whether a firm earns higher/lower wealth gains than its partner: (1) its potential for earning private benefits and (2) its ability to extract private benefits. As a test of the impact of the first factor, I propose that when a JV is formed, the partner that possesses more valuable resources is likely to earn lower wealth gains whereas the partner that possesses less valuable resources is likely to earn higher wealth gains because its potential for earning private benefits over the course of the venture is also higher. I then argue that the partner with less valuable resources is likely to extract higher private benefits and gain more when it has greater bargaining power and absorptive capacity. Conversely, the partner with more valuable resources is likely to protect itself better from appropriation when it has JV capabilities. I find support for these arguments in a sample of 344 ventures. The implications are that private benefits significantly influence value creation in JVs, and that a broad array of contingencies and factors affect these benefits which need to be considered when entering into a cooperation. © 2010 INFORMS."

Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The results show that there exist two kinds of absorptive capacity: demand-pull and science-push. Their most important determinants proved to be internal R&D, training of personnel, innovation co-operation and attitude toward change. Both kinds of absorptive capacity are positively related to product and process innovation output.

Further, I explicate how these KM processes correlate with the offshore contract performance. The KM centric offshore performance model is validated by utilizing matched-pair survey data collected from 160 offshore software development projects. Results provide insights into the relative importance of both SC and AC in affecting the extent of KT and KC in client-vendor relationships. Further, I find that SC and KT are relatively more important in the research context. Besides providing important implications, through a series of post-hoc analyses, this study demonstrates the theoretical parsimony achieved by considering both SC and AC together, thereby providing a reference 'offshore contract performance model' for future research."

Antecedents to potential absorptive capacity include three types of interorganizational contexts-knowledge, relational, and institutional. At the intraorganizational level, knowledge-based views of the firm stress how patterns of interaction and relationships among individuals facilitate knowledge integration within the organization. Two types of social context are emphasized-the extent of social embeddedness and closeness of interfunctional coupling. Implications for managerial practice are also discussed. © 2009 M.E.

By complementing the concept of absorptive capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities' as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive, transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity. 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, and innovation performance. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

We argue that firms from transition and established economies differ in their search pattern and that these search patterns moderate the relationship between innovation inputs and outputs. Based on a sample of almost 7,000 firms from 13 European countries we find strong support for open innovation strategies in both settings. However, performance differs in established market and transition economy contexts."

To benefit from the recent outsourcing boom in ICT services, India's government has directed investments into the restructuring and expansion of the local ICT services sector, positioning the country among the most popular ICT services outsourcing destinations. Drawing on national innovation system theory and concepts of absorptive capacity, this paper questions the sustainability of India's success as a top ICT offshoring destination. In the immediate distance, eroding cost advantages and unsophisticated service exports are threatening India's top position. To avoid competition in the low-segments of ICT services exports, India would have to move up the value chain, requiring the expansion of the ICT services sector into higher spheres of software design and development. However, as this paper argues, the expansion of this industry is constrained by the enormous variation in inter-state levels of ICT education and infrastructure. The poor absorptive capacity of the remaining part of the country is found to severely limit the industry's expansion possibilities. As empirically shown, state efforts to build a learning system exclusively for the ICT sector have prevented a nation-wide investment in absorptive capacity. Therefore this paper proposes that resolving these inter-state disparities requires the development of learning capabilities outside the ICT industry; enabling the remaining economic sectors to absorb the benefits generated by the expansion of the ICT sector. However, until this aim is achieved, India's ICT sector may have long lost its competitive advantage. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

We hypothesize that strong intrafirm networks help business units accrue intellectual capital (knowledge and knowing capabilities) and that this relationship is facilitated by two of the four conditions needed by organizations to exchange resources, as specified by previous research studies (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1997). These are the cultural attributes of collective rewards and cooperative norms, and absorptive capacity. Partial least square technique is used to analyze data, which is collected by administering surveys to 375 business unit heads/managers. The study's results endorse the direct relationship between strong intrafirm networks and intellectual capital and except for the moderation of cultural attributes on the relationship between intrafirm networks and knowledge, no significant moderating relationships are found."

The findings support the study's hypothesis that goal similarity and business relatedness positively influence technology acquisition. However, contrary to expectations, there is no support for the view that organizational cultural compatibility is positively related to technology acquisition. We also do not find support for anticipated positive relationships between organizational cultural compatibility, goal similarity, business relatedness, and IA performance.

Using a systems integrator as the sourcing firm's perspective, the authors argue that complex KIBSs involve a complicated mixture of interfaces in that the performance of an individual KIBS is insufficient in defining the overall performance of the integrated KIBS system. The theoretical framework uses a two-stage strategic fit model that emphasizes the conditions under which global sourcing of KIBSs influences performance. Firms that strategically coalign sourcing strategy with KIBS attributes for each KIBS activity should perform more effectively than firms that lack such a coalignment. After selecting an appropriate sourcing strategy, the firm's dynamic capabilities (i.e., absorptive capacity and integration capability) may accentuate or attenuate the performance of the strategy at the integrated KIBS system level. Thus, although managers may be tempted to source KIBSs globally to reduce labor costs, they must examine both the KIBS attributes and the firm's dynamic capabilities. © 2009, American Marketing Association."

In line with theories on the absorptive capacity of firms, we argue on the basis of an empirical analysis of Hungarian firms that larger and more productive firms are more able than smaller firms to reap spillovers from multinationals.

In contrast, firms with greater absorptive capacity benefit more. These results are largely robust to the inclusion of firm fixed effects, industry-year and region-year fixed effects, and other controls, and indicate the importance of firm capabilities in moderating the effect of downstream FDI on productivity.

Compatible organisational characteristics are a particularly important component for absorptive capacity in that it may play a pivotal role in extending the prior relevant knowledge base and promoting a favourable learning environment. A series of hypotheses based on the literature is tested, which suggests that: there is a close association between IJV size and the level of knowledge acquisition, and compatible characteristics between parents positively influence marketing knowledge acquisition in IJVs. Design/methodology/approach - The data were obtained by a survey. Questionnaires were posted to the CEOs of IJVs in Korea. A total of 688 questionnaires were sent out and 128 were returned, giving a response rate of 18.6 per cent. Findings - The paper finds that the marginal differences in mean values indicate that firm size does not significantly influence the extent of knowledge acquisition in IJVs. A series of regression analyses was undertaken and it was found that the impact of compatible organisational culture on knowledge acquisition was positive and significant. Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations to the study. First, the data used were collected from only one country. Second, only marketing skills were considered, leaving aside other important types of knowledge that can contribute to IJV operations. Third, the measurement used for the acquisition of marketing knowledge has some drawbacks, in that it is based on the perceptual judgements of key managers, without employing objective measurements. In addition, the relatively low response rate and the low number of responses from large firms are clearly further limitations. Practical implications - The findings suggest that compatible culture should be a crucial partner selection criterion for both local and foreign firms. Originality/value - Very few studies have analysed small and medium-sized IJVs, and fewer have focused on marketing knowledge acquisition particularly in a dynamically energetic environment (South Korea in this case). The paper also contributes to the current literature by confirming the positive relationship between compatible organisational culture and marketing knowledge acquisition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach - To answer this question, the notion of absorptive capacity (ACAP) is applied to explain some of the problems faced in moving from face-to-face HR to a technology-mediated model. Findings - Dynamic ACAP models are adapted to produce a more realistic, iterative framework in which realized capacities for e-HR innovations contribute to, and constrain, potential capacities for further innovations. Research limitations/implications - The model is used to offer some research propositions for academics operating in this newly emerging field of human resource management (HRM). Practical implications - Some theory-driven advice are also offered for HR practitioners. Originality/value - The specific contribution is to introduce the concept of ACAP to HRM scholars and practitioners interested in the field of e-HR and Web 2.0 social media. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In the context of cross-cultural training, can the amount of previously accumulated cultural knowledge affect the ability of a trainee to absorb further learning about a new culture, thus enhancing total knowledge and presumably cross-cultural adjustment? In-country cross-cultural training was hypothesized to be more effective when the training components are divided and the sessions are distributed over time - resulting in increased cultural knowledge and greater cross-cultural adjustment. Results from an experimental design suggested that in-country cross-cultural training can increase cultural knowledge, when distributed over time. The results also suggested that the training group had greater differences between pre-training and post-training scores on cross-cultural adjustment, but the differences were not statistically different. The results, methodology and conclusions can be generalized to a variety of populations (e.g. international managers and expatriates) and organizations (e.g. multinationals). For international managers and expatriates, the results showed that in-country cross-cultural training, like predeparture cross-cultural training, is also a viable intervention for knowledge acquisition. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

The aim is to identify mechanisms that influence green innovation and environmental performance in a construction company. Data come from a questionnaire survey assessing environmental attitudes, management and performance within the Swedish construction industry. For data analysis, linear regression analysis was used. From testing the ACAP theory and model, it was concluded that it has a promising potential in explaining mechanisms behind green innovation and performance. The application of ACAP has resulted in a revised ACAP model, green ACAP. Findings indicate that organizations can affect their capacity to absorb green innovations and improve their business performance by focusing on three predictors of green business advantage: acquisition, assimilation and transformation. As such, the green ACAP can serve as a framework for focused efforts within the construction industry."

The recent surge of entrepreneurship policies encompasses a wide variety of instruments and goals that are mainly designed and implemented at a regional or local level, which allows for a more efficient use of public resources. Case studies are therefore a useful approach to assessing good practices in entrepreneurship policies. We adopt this approach to empirically analyse whether policies are targeting specific entrepreneurial projects or not in the region of Valencia. We identify the features (in relation to the entrepreneur, the sector and the characteristics of the project itself) that may influence greater access to public funding and are principally related to standard requirements for this means of financing. These variables do not address specific entrepreneurial profiles, sectors or applicant projects, thereby revealing a substantial degree of horizontal policy design. Other features, such as almost all entrepreneurial characteristics (previous experience, age, etc.), do not seem relevant in terms of receiving public funds. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009."

This paper discusses the policy issues and challenges that cohesion and accession countries face, applying lessons that by now have become mainstream in the parallel discussion of FDI-assisted development in the developing economies. We argue that globalization has attenuated the benefits that accrue from EU membership for latecomers, and that they must now compete for FDI not just with other European countries but also with non-EU emerging economies. We posit that they should not base their industrial development strategy on mere passive reliance on FDI flows without considering how to concatenate their industrial development and the nature of the TNC activities they attract."

Applying an ambidexterity perspective to a firm's technology sourcing strategy, we hypothesize that a curvilinear relationship exists between a firm's technology sourcing mix and its performance. We further introduce a contingency element by proposing that a firm's absorptive capacity exerts a positive moderating effect on this relationship. We empirically test these hypotheses on a random, multi-industry sample of U.S. manufacturing companies. We find support for the notion that the relationship between technology sourcing mix and firm performance is an inverted U-shape. Moreover, higher levels of absorptive capacity allow a firm to more fully capture the benefits resulting from ambidexterity in technology sourcing. ©2009 INFORMS."

Owing to the high rate of change in competitive dynamics within transformation economies, SMEs seek to develop new knowledge themselves or, more likely, transfer, adapt and implement new knowledge obtained from outside sources in order to increase their competitiveness. The effectiveness of identifying and transferring new knowledge and best practice depends to an extent on the level of absorptive capacity of the organisation, which, it can be argued, is strongly related to its inherent level of Human Resource Development (HRD). This paper reports the initial results of a research project which investigates the priorities for HRD in SMEs to enable managers to identify, transfer, assess and implement new knowledge gained through access to external sources. The study identifies significant differences between HRD priorities identified by management and the preferences of employees and potential employees in the form of undergraduate business students. The conclusions indicate that firms should consider the importance of both their own and employees' motivational factors in managing knowledge transfer mechanisms.

This research contributes to existing literature by examining how absorptive capacity affects the relationships between different types of partners and product innovation performance. The sample used in this research is drawn from the Taiwanese Technological Innovation Survey (TTIS) database. A moderated hierarchical regression approach is used to analyze the models, which are further explored by firm size and industry type. Some interesting findings appear. First, absorptive capacity positively moderates the impact of vertical collaboration on the performance of technologically new or improved products. Second, the effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between supplier collaboration and the performance of new products with marginal changes varies based on firm size and industry type. Third, absorptive capacity negatively affects the relationship between customer collaboration and the performance of marginally changed products. Fourth, absorptive capacity positively affects the relationship between competitor collaboration and the performance of new products with marginal changes for large firms. Fifth, absorptive capacity negatively affects the relationship between collaboration with research organizations and the performance of technologically new or improved products. On the contrary, absorptive capacity positively affects the impact of collaboration with research organizations on the performance of marginally changed products.

However, the empirical evidence for this relationship remains inconsistent. On the one hand, the Schumpeterian viewpoint credits that the large firms with substantial monopoly market power have resources and incentives to innovate. On the other hand, it is also possible for a monopolist to have incentives to suppress subsequent innovations. It is suggested by Baldwin and Scott (1987) and Tang (2006) that the relationship between competition and innovation is dependent on the competition context and specific type of innovation activities. In this study, we investigate the relationship between foreign competition and pioneering innovation and consider the moderating role of absorptive capacity for this relationship, using the Canadian Innovation Data. We find a U-shaped relationship between foreign competition and pioneering innovation: when foreign competition increases from a low to a moderate level, the likelihood of pioneering innovation decreases. However, the likelihood of pioneering innovation increases when foreign competition continues to increase from a moderate to a high level. We also found evidence that absorptive capacity may positively moderate the relationship between foreign competition and pioneering innovation. © Imperial College Press."

Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) activities give these firms a foundation for building and exploiting these capabilities. In turn, stimulating and sustaining CE requires the infusion of resources and new knowledge into the firm's operations, using multiple external sources. In this paper, we highlight the importance of boards of directors and absorptive capacity for gaining access to varied and current knowledge that enriches CE. We suggest that boards and absorptive capacity complement each other in fueling CE activities. Further, boards can sometimes substitute for poor absorptive capacity and vice versa, influencing the intensity of CE activities. Managing these complementarities (or substitutions) is crucial for sustaining CE initiatives and creating value from them. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

A framework showing the complementarities between those two fields is set up. After a literature review on those two fields we explain that economic intelligence and knowledge management are two complementary aspects of a single issue, namely supporting companies' global performance. Economic intelligence shows a major focus on explicit knowledge whereas knowledge management encompasses both tacit and explicit knowledge. Both concepts emphasise the following criteria (learning practices, innovation systems, decision making and understanding) relying on similar processes. Those processes encompass various fields ranging from information search to knowledge analysis and interpretation. They also cover information sharing, collaborative work and learning practices. The goals of both concepts are to increase the organisation's absorptive capacity. This requires a necessary integration between those two concepts (economic intelligence and knowledge management). The issue could be thus: Which of the two concepts might absorb the other? The answer to this question is critical in so far as it may affect the deployment of those strategic functions within organisations."

In this study, we adopt a multi-dimensional view of absorptive capacity and focus specifically on the application of external knowledge that has been obtained via university-firm collaborations. We examine various organizational conditions that we propose influence a firm's ability to apply external knowledge for explorative and exploitative innovations. We collected data by a survey of firms in industries that frequently work with university research centres (URCs) and from publicly available sources. Results show that predictors of exploration and exploitation of the application of external knowledge differ. Surprisingly, technological relatedness, a common measure of absorptive capacity, is negatively associated with the application of external knowledge to explorative innovations, indicating that knowledge from more distant sources is applied more to exploration. Results also indicate that the effects of two external learning capabilities (prior experience with URCs and technological capability) on knowledge application are moderated in such a way by the tacitness of the knowledge transferred that experience is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more explicit and technological capability is a stronger predictor when the knowledge is more tacit. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on the application of external knowledge. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Trust and communication are found to be the most important factors in biotech cooperation. Interestingly, trust is significantly more important for European firms than for US companies. This indicates that the technology sourcing process in these countries is different. The authors also found that cooperation with universities does result in a similarly high rate of new products (of above 60%) than alliances with other firms. Furthermore, when cooperating with universities, the companies do not deem biotechnology to yield a great competitive advantage. Thus, the authors assume that the technology sourcing process is not as important for the generation of resources than the absorptive capacity. Copyright © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

With the Condeep design it became possible to speak of an independent Norwegian petroleum industry. In the R&D system of Norway, petroleum education and research were introduced at several levels.

Further, it analyzes empirical studies which have explored the impacts of such transactions on R&D spending or R&D/corporate innovation performance criteria. The review suggests a rejection of popular claims that a TRA is significantly triggered by a weak R&D position of the buyer and leads to lower R&D inputs and outputs of the transaction partners. These allegations do not sufficiently acknowledge the subtleties of the interrelations between R&D and a TRA. Rather, the evidence implies that management scholars and practitioners should scrutinize (1) R&D/technology absorptive capacities of the acquiring firm, (2) combination opportunities and substantive overlaps of the transaction parties' R&D themes and (3) management interventions to transform acquisition-based R&D value creation potentials into real value after the formal deal closure. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

The evidence drawn on includes large-scale econometric models based on two unique data sets, an in-depth interview survey and a questionnaire survey. The key conclusions are, firstly, that strong clusters promote entrepreneurship, which in turn promotes cluster strength in a self-reinforcing dynamic. Secondly, some firms are better able than others to benefit from cluster location due to superior firm competencies and absorptive capacity. Thirdly, cluster strength contributes to the ability of entrepreneurial firms to expand overseas. Importing activity is also extensive. Internationalisation is one dynamic feedback loop in cluster strength, whereby increased internationalisation yields benefits to firms which spill over more widely in the cluster, and leads to further internationalisation. The Resource-Based View (RBV) emerges as an important theoretical framework linking cluster theory and international entrepreneurship. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers."

This knowledge transfer involved two groups of researchers: the experts and the learners. These groups are from geographically dispersed regions and evolve in distinct contexts by their language and culture. Design/methodology/approach: The paper favors the learning history (LH) technique, a methodology that enabled the different participants to share their experience through reiterate interviews. Findings: Based on the dynamic knowledge transfer capacity model, the absorptive capacity of the train the trainers process appears to have been mobilized. Although there were a number of hitches, people are confident that the project will be successful and that they will put what they have learned to good use in upcoming phases to transfer this program to other organizations. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions apply solely to a context of interprovincial transfer of a train the trainers program.

We propose a new real options model where both organizational capabilities and technological learning are emphasized. Our model demonstrates that when a company is capable of reaping sufficient benefits from preemptive learning of a new information technology, it will expedite its adoption of the technology under greater uncertainty. When exogenous gains created by technology advance are independent of technological learning, they tend to have minimal impact on the company's optimal adoption strategy. The results of our analysis also support the view that existing technology capabilities may lead to competency traps hindering a company's technological adaptation. © 2009 IEEE."

It concludes that establishtying a global production network can be a catalyst for organizational learning and the development of new competencies; in particular, that the complexities and uncertainties of operating in unfamiliar economic and cultural contexts provide a powerful impetus to increasing a firm's absorptive capacity. The article identifies the strategies that enabled the Hyundai Motor Company to learn from its initial failures in overseas production. It focuses on the localization of production, the internal transfer of experienced staff, the codification of previous experience and the use of aggressive goal-setting. The analysis suggests that organizational resilience, that is the ability to rebound from initial failure, is a further important aspect in the process of organizational learning. © 2009 Taylor & Francis."

We develop a combined real options and game-theoretic model of modal choice by incorporating a range of factors drawn from the dynamic capabilities theory and transaction cost or organizational economics. The factors scrutinized in the model include the parties' absorptive capacities, frictions in knowledge and asset markets and associated incentive problems, cost of switching from one mode to another and cost associated with power jockeying. The model uses simulation to examine how these factors interact to influence the choice of mode. The results identify a number of conditions for one factor to dominate another, and help to reconcile different theories that have made contradicting predictions with regard to the effects of such factors as uncertainty and capability divergence on the optimal choice of mode. © 2009 Academy of International Business.

Funding and human resources devoted to Research and Development (R&D) have been considerable in Russia, but so far, the innovation activity and R&D output has been modest. In order to achieve sustainable growth, Russia needs to change from a natural resource-based economy to a knowledge-oriented economy. Knowledge absorption from foreign investors in Russia is defined in a general level conceptually. Innovation indicators, such as domestic R&D expenditures and the level of higher education, are used to measure the overall absorptive capacity in Russia. It is assumed that Russia is, at the moment, more focused on imitating existing innovations than creating its own science-based innovations. The results of a statistical analysis indicate that the inflow of technology in the form of foreign investments and trade meet favourable technology/innovation absorption conditions in the Russian regions. Foreign investors are significant actors in the knowledge absorption framework. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

The goal is to determine the type of knowledge which firms need, to exploit new and emerging markets.

Furthermore, our finding also suggests that firm's abilities to understand external knowledge will be more positively associated with its knowledge acquisition when the information embeddedness is high, and firm's abilities to apply external knowledge and knowledge acquisition will be more positively associated with the firm performance when the work embeddedness is high.

This development process involves considerable risk and uncertainty and may require substantial resources to fund early stage operations while returns are uncertain. Hence there is a need to explore risk-minimisation approaches relating to proving the potential for development while concurrently allocating resources in an incremental manner. This paper focuses on the development of the Northern Ireland Proof of Concept (PoC) process within a University Science Park Incubator (USI) as a particular approach to addressing these challenges inherent in the United Kingdom University technology transfer. Furthermore, Absorptive Capacity has emerged in the literature as an appropriate theoretical framework or lens for exploring the development and application of new technology. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the PoC process within a USI as a means for improving the commercialisation of University technology transfer using an Absorptive Capacity perspective. A multiple case analysis of PoC applications within a UK university is described. From the findings it emerges that Absorptive Capacity influencing factors such as levels of R&D investment, prior knowledge base and integration of stakeholder and technology planning all impact on PoC outcomes. In addition a number of process improvement areas for PoC are identified in relation to the influencing factors within the Absorptive Capacity framework. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Recent studies suggest that information gained through CVC-related activities can improve the internal R&D productivity of established firms. This study investigates an alternative means by which information gained through CVC investing could improve firm performance-by increasing the returns to corporate investors when acquiring startups. We provide new insights based on an event study of the returns to 34 corporate investors from acquiring 242 technology startups. Consistent with predictions drawn from the absorptive capacity literature, we find that the effect of CVC investing on acquisition performance hinges critically on the strength of the acquirer's internal knowledge base: as CVC investments increase relative to an acquirer's total R&D expenditures, acquisition performance improves at a diminishing rate. We also find that firms consistently engaged in venture financing earn greater returns when acquiring startups than do firms with more sporadic patterns of investing, even controlling for firm profitability, size, and acquisition experience. These findings suggest that corporate investors systematically differ in their abilities to derive added benefits from external venturing as acquirers of entrepreneurial firms. © 2009 INFORMS."

The focus on endogenous change complements the current emphasis in the literature on how dynamic capabilities help firms cope with the risk of core rigidities following an exogenous shock. Our comparison of two collaborating firms shows that, at the operating capability level, firms build absorptive capacity in value networks during their product development experiences and this learning needs to be captured at the product portfolio planning level. When this learning is captured and transformed, product portfolio planning acts as a dynamic capability reconfiguring operating capabilities based on beliefs about follow-on entrepreneurial opportunities. Under conditions of endogenous change, dynamic capabilities are guided by a proactive entrepreneurial logic, complementing the need for reactive adaptive responses in circumstances of exogenous change. A key implication is that dynamic capabilities have a more expansive and critical role in the adaptation of firms than previously considered. Our theorizing shows how interactions between dynamic and operating capabilities build the adaptive capacity of the organization. © 2009 British Academy of Management."

This study examined the effects of three antecedents on this pair of learning dichotomy: knowledge flow, buyer relations, and transnational strategy. We surveyed a group of manufacturing firms in Taiwan where contract manufacturing is prevalent. The results showed that exploitation learning from the focal firm's key buyer was positively related to all three independent variables: knowledge transfer from the buyer, buyer relations between the two firms, and the focal firm's own transnational strategy. On the other hand, exploration learning from the key buyer was positively related to only buyer relations and transnational strategy. Furthermore, while buyer relations and transnational strategy had about equal effect on exploitation, the effect of transnational strategy on exploration was almost twice that of buyer relations on exploration. The prevailing effects of transnational strategy confirm the absorptive capacity view that effective learning requires internal capability. Particularly for exploration learning, this internal capability happens to be transnational strategy in this study."

Design/methodology/approach: An embedded case study of Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) examining core drivers that impact on inter-unit knowledge transfers between six events and exhibitions (E&E) units located in Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Findings: The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity. Research limitations/implications: The focus is on one specific manufacturing sector and specific drivers to knowledge transfer in this sector, limiting the generalisation of the findings. Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of in-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach. Practical implications: The paper offers guidelines for firms and specifically E&E managers to observe the specificity of knowledge and how this affects its limited applicability for other identical units. Originality/value: Managers foremost need is to examine the unique context under which knowledge is acquired; only then are they in a position to decide how much knowledge transfer via different network and communication channels is needed between geographically dispersed E&E units. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

On the basis that foreign-owned firms may encourage firms in their extended supply chain to improve their environment-related management practices, evidence for the existence of environmental spillovers should be easier to find than productivity spillovers where firms naturally attempt to minimise intra-industry knowledge leakage. In this paper we show that, first, foreign-owned firms are more likely to implement environmental management systems (EMS) and, second, that the presence of foreign-owned firms in those sectors that a firm supplies can encourage good environmental practice. This is especially true if a firm is foreign, has high absorptive capacity, and operates in the presence of formal and informal networks. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Antecedents of adoption include prior investments in AMT, developments in firms' manufacturing capabilities, technology strategy, absorptive capacity, and environmental pressures. Based on a sample of 87 Greek manufacturing SMEs, we find that AMT adoption follows an incremental, piecemeal progression from the least complicated through intermediate to integrated technologies. It is found that an increase in the firms' quality and flexibility capabilities induces them to adopt further AMT, whereas advances in low-cost, innovation, and delivery capabilities appear negatively related to further AMT adoption. Absorptive capacity, technology strategy and environmental pressures play a central role in decisions for additional investments in AMT.

At the same time, coal cleaning needed to be improved in order to offer higher quality coal against lower coal processing costs. In this paper we illustrate how State Mines relied on its innovative capacity in order to overcome the economic, technological and market changes. The coal cleaning innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing coal cleaning processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in coal cleaning. The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge. An important feature was that State Mines was always well aware of its lack of capabilities and knowledge and open to search for and learn from knowledge outside its firm boundaries. Moreover, expectations determined the search for external knowledge. © 2009 Taylor & Francis."

Rather than relying on their own, limited resources for research and development in the traditional, closed invention system, firms are encouraged to share knowledge across firm boundaries to enhance their innovative potential. Yet, such sharing may also have adverse consequences by reducing the rarity of a firm’s inventions. This paper accordingly attempts to identify and analyze the parameters that determine whether open or closed types of innovation management are most appropriate for a given firm. Following a contingency perspective, we examine these determinants as various internal and external constraints (situational factors). More specifically, applying concepts related to absorptive capacity, complementary resources, game theory and others, we derive testable propositions and provide case study evidence regarding the value generating properties of open innovation. © Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, 2009."

However, incorporating end users raises some interesting challenges regarding how to balance the decision making power between a firm and the user community. Using Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we propose hypotheses based on the perceived attributes of end user ideas and end user promotion efforts. Our findings suggest that the decision to adopt a user innovation was based on the ability of the firm to understand the technical requirements and respond to community concerns regarding the innovation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Is technology acquisition enough to improve China's product quality? Evidence from firm-level panel data","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57049107411&doi=10.1080%2f10438590701560402&partnerID=40&md5=877a17fbdbea6774413e7123e5ddcbe6","As developing countries open themselves up to trade, many industrial firms in these countries are finding it difficult to compete internationally due to poor product quality and low product variety. Although China has been the largest producer of crude steel since 1996, China's steel firms have produced an overabundance of low-quality steel while domestic purchasers of steel have increasingly demanded higher quality steel products. Many have argued that for Chinese steel firms to improve product quality they must adopt more advanced technologies. Employing firm-level panel data of steel firms in China, we econometrically test the relative importance of two possible sets of factors affecting a firm's ability to utilize technology to improve product quality: technology acquisition factors and technology absorptive capacity factors. We find that technology complements such as in-house R&D and foreign knowledge must be combined with technology for Chinese firms to improve product quality."

First the concept of project-based company is described. Then the discussion deals with the epistemological assumptions with the goal of getting a better understanding of the nature of knowledge and how it develops. This is followed by a brief illustrations of autopoietic and allopoietic systems. After that the concepts of structural determinism and coupling are highlighted. Then follow descriptions of the knowledge creation at both the individual and organizational levels. Also three factors (i.e. absorptive capacity, creative tension and resistance to change) that either foster or weaken possibilities to achieve structural coupling are illustrated. The paper's end concludes with a discussion concerning why structural coupling is necessary for project-based companies, since because without it the company-in other words, an autopoietic system-disintegrates and the company's activities come to an end. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Firms located in similarly structured networks rich in structural holes may obtain different performance results depending on their (1) capacity to absorb heterogeneous information, (2) ability to protect against partner noncooperation, and (3) bargaining power. In this paper, I argue that firms with a wide scope of experience have superior absorptive capacity for dealing with heterogeneous information; hence, such firms will be able to extract performance improvements from network positions rich in structural holes. Furthermore, firms with a high level of historic multimarket contact (MMC) with their partners are able to reduce the risks of partner noncooperation, hence augmenting their performance compared to firms in open networks that do not enjoy MMC with their own partners. Finally, firms of low centrality in the industry's network of alliances will extract performance benefits from enhancing bargaining power as a result of exploiting brokerage opportunities in open networks. These arguments are corroborated in a study of relationships formed among investment banks' advising on the merger and acquisition transactions in the United Kingdom between 1992 and 2001. ©2009 INFORMS."
"Alliance portfolio internationalization","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896435209&partnerID=40&md5=bd0b36de8c640e623e860ddf204521e5","Alliance research has traditionally focused on structural and relational aspects of the networks in which firms are situated, paying less attention to the inherent characteristics of their partners. This study introduces the notion of alliance portfolio internationalization (API), which refers to the degree of foreignness of partners in a firm's collection of immediate alliance relationships. We develop a framework to explain how API impacts firm performance. We suggest that as a firm's API increases, financial performance is expected to initially decline, then improve, and finally decline again. This sigmoid relationship between API and financial performance is ascribed to evolving learning effects that shape the net benefits of API. When the firm's alliance portfolio, on average, consists of proximate foreign partners, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences, but at moderate levels of API, its absorptive capacity and specialized collaborative routines support the exchange of valuable network resources. Nevertheless, high levels of API undermine firm performance because of the failure of collaborative routines and mounting liabilities of cross-national differences. We test the framework using data on the alliance portfolios of U.S.-based software firms during the period from 1990 to 2001. The results provide support for the sigmoid relationship as well as for our predictions that firms which have gained experience with foreign partners and maintained wholly owned subsidiaries in their partners' countries of origin can overcome some of the liabilities of API and better leverage its benefits. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Technological capability and absorptive capacity still play an important role in building competitiveness at the firm level. The purpose of this paper is to show that collective capability as an industry – in addition to firm-level capability – is increasingly becoming crucial in negotiating and influencing the decision-making process at the global level as firms become embedded in the global network of knowledge creation. The case of standards compliance in the Chilean salmon industry is presented as a tangible case to demonstrate the importance of nurturing collective capability as firms interact with global forces. In this case, standards act as a platform for learning to act collectively among networks of stakeholders. The results suggest the importance of paying strategic attention – both at the corporate and policy levels – to upgrade the collective capability of firms in addition to conventional firm-level capabilities. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

It uses an argument from a recent information processing model, which advocates using unique information in a diverse group. A distinction between static and dynamic resources is made where the static dimension addresses board capital and the dynamic one the absorptive capacity. Board capital is discussed in terms of information diversity, while absorptive capacity in terms of three practices that tap unique information. Structural Equation Modeling is applied with survey data collected in years 2003 and 2005. The results suggest different effects of board capital and absorptive capacity on board strategic task performance. Board capital seems to enhance the board's future strategic task performance, while absorptive capacity the board's current strategic task performance."

However, it can be associated with higher performance if accompanied by organizational change. The identification of the variables describing organizational change is still on-going work. This paper focuses on organizational absorptive capacity and analyses its effects on the relationship between IT and business performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Organizational absorptive capacity measures the ability of an organization to complete a learning process. A significant learning effort is typically associated with IT, as it represents a complex technology. To cope with IT's complexity, implementation is typically incremental and is accompanied by a continuous integration effort of data and applications. The degree of integration of a company's information system (IS), called IS integration, is a proxy of IT maturity and quality. In this study, we explore the effect of IS integration on business performance through absorptive capacity, that is, we hypothesize that absorptive capacity has a mediation role between IS integration and business performance. The proposed research model is tested with data surveyed from 466 SMEs sited in Italy, for which exports constitute more than half of their revenues. Results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity has a mediation effect. Alternative models attributing to absorptive capacity a role different from mediation are found to be non-significant. © 2008 JIT Palgrave Macmillan. All rights reserved."

We test these hypotheses empirically based on a survey of more than 2,200 German firms. We find that the globalization of absorptive capacities is a combination of refining their development (most importantly through ambitious incentive systems), export experience and shortcomings of the domestic innovation environment. The importance of each individual factor varies with regards to the source of the impulse, i.e. whether it stems from foreign customers, suppliers or competitors. © Gabler Verlag 2008."

One explanation is that the results of these empirical studies are sensitive to the measures of absorptive capacity used. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by investigating average years of schooling and total factor productivity gap as measures of host country absorptive capacity in 38 developed and developing countries. Panel data regression equations are estimated using a cross-sectionally heteroskedastic and timewise autoregressive (CHTA) model. The paper has two main results. The first result does not support the hypothesis that the technology diffusion from MNEs has a positive impact on the productivity growth in developing countries. The second result is that the total factor productivity gap is more appropriate than average years of schooling to measure host country absorptive capacity. This may suggest that the results of previous studies that used average years of schooling should be interpreted with caution. © 2008 Institute of East and West Studies, Yonsei University, Seoul."

The attendant prescription is to invest more in R&D to derive greater benefit from the R&D of others (spillovers). Empirical tests of R&D productivity typically find absorptive capacity (R&D * rival R&D) to be significant. This result poses a puzzle, however: What can a firm conducting 50% of industry R&D learn from a set of firms each conducting 5%? Aren't the laggard firms merely playing catch-up? Yet, if this is so, why is the interaction term significant? One possible resolution to this puzzle is that the correlation between R&D spending and returns is really about innate ability (IQ) rather than investment behavior (absorptive capacity). In this view the causality between capability and behavior is reversed. It is not that firms obtain higher returns by investing more in R&D; it is that some firms have higher returns to R&D, thus they invest more. I conduct an empirical test of the competing views and find that (1) firms differ in the output elasticities of their own R&D (IQ) as well as the elasticities of spillovers from rivals, (2) absorptive capacity becomes insignificant when accounting for that heterogeneity, (3) R&D investment increases with IQ, but (4) R&D investment has no impact on a firm's ability to benefit from spillovers. © 2008 INFORMS."

Here we analyze the role of an alliance network in terms of the technological distance between partners, a firm's network position (centrality) and total network density. We study how these three elements of an alliance network, separately and in combination, affect the 'twin tasks' in exploration, namely novelty creation on the one hand and its efficient absorption on the other hand. For an empirical test, we study technology-based alliance networks in the pharmaceutical, chemical and automotive industries. Our findings indicate that successful exploration indeed seems to require a delicate balance between these two exploration tasks. A second conclusion is that different network positions yield different pay-offs in terms of the number of explorative patents. In other words, success rates for exploration are not spread equally across firms. However, position alone does not tell the full story. Our empirical findings clearly indicate that exploration success also depends on the other two dimensions of embeddedness, namely technological distance and network density. The three elements of network embeddedness need to be considered jointly in order to understand their complementary effects on both novelty creation and absorptive capacity. © 2008."

To this end, the paper integrates two well-established yet largely unrelated notions about the inventive process.

On the other hand, firms continuously renew and transform the knowledge that flows through this network as a consequence of their knowledge absorption and knowledge generation activities. Bringing these views together allows us to present a more encompassing picture of the inventive process, and it yields a set of novel testable hypotheses. Based on a sample of companies operating in the semiconductor industry over the period 1976-2002, our hypotheses are corroborated."

"From capability to connectivity-Absorptive capacity and exploratory alliances in biopharmaceutical firms: A US-Europe comparison","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52049113435&doi=10.1016%2fj.technovation.2008.03.007&partnerID=40&md5=27fcedaf7cc3f71fd1e007725fcbb193","In this paper, we explore the relationship between aspects of firms' potential absorptive capacity (PACAP) on their involvement in exploratory alliances. Our study is based on survey data from firms in the US and European (the UK, Germany, France and Ireland) biopharmaceutical sectors. We use zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models to capture the number of exploratory alliances in which firms are engaged, and find that the assimilation dimension of PACAP is significantly more important than the acquisition dimension. More specifically, we find that skill levels and continuous R&D play an important role in determining biopharmaceutical firms' exploratory alliance activity, while R&D intensity proves relatively unimportant. Our results also highlight differences between the determinants of alliance behaviour in the US and Europe: in the US firms' skill levels prove more significant, while in Europe continuity of R&D proves more significant. Commonalities are also observed, however, with firms' strategic focus and an inverted 'U' shaped relationship between firm size and alliance engagement evident in both areas. © 2008."

Manufacturing capabilities are enhanced by supplier innovativeness directly, because of the embedded nature of the supplied component, and indirectly, as the manufacturer learns from its suppliers. We use organizational learning theory to develop a conceptual model of learning factors that act as contingencies and magnify the effect of supplier innovativeness. First, we argue that a manufacturer's absorptive capacity, its ability to learn and use external knowledge, positively moderates the impact of supplier innovativeness on the manufacturer's performance. Second, we examine how different combinations of manufacturer-supplier learning styles lead to relatively more or less interorganizational learning, contingent upon whether the outsourcing is design versus manufacturing oriented. Our model can help managers consider knowledge transfer as part of their supplier selection criteria. © 2008 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.™."

This study explores whether knowledge gaps tend to increase or decrease with time when operating in the foreign market, and it discusses which learning components narrow - or widen - the perceived knowledge gap. A theoretical model is developed based on the internationalization process view and the more recent organizational learning perspective, including such concepts as overconfidence and absorptive capacity. The theoretical model is tested on a set of primary data covering Danish and Swedish firms and their foreign market operations. The results suggest a more subtle relationship between experience and perceived knowledge gaps than the ""mechanical"" relationship portrayed by the internationalization process view - a relationship in which absorptive capacity and, in particular, overconfidence play important roles. © 2008 Academy of International Business All rights reserved."

This paper examines the role of IT in the context of international business to business (B2B) relationship and its contribution to supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach - This literature review paper develops a conceptual model of IT-mediated relationships in international supply chain relationships. The framework integrates transaction cost economics and resource-based theory perspectives and argues that IT capabilities facilitate supply chain performance, deter partner's opportunism and this process is mediated by B2B processes. Moreover, environmental, relational, cultural and country level moderators are examined. Findings - It is suggested that IT capabilities contribute directly to improved organizational process such as coordination, transaction specific investment, absorptive capacity and monitoring. These in turn contribute to strategic and operational performance outcomes. Against a resource-based as well as a transaction-cost theory background it is suggested that partner interdependence and environmental, country and cultural factors moderate the process of IT contribution on performance. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides a number of propositions which can be tested empirically in future studies. Practical implications - Managers should focus on the complementarities of IT capabilities. Electronic integration in combination with, for example, human IT resources may enhance supply chain performance and mitigate the moderating effects of environmental, relational, cultural and country factors. Originality/value - The paper develops an integrated conceptual model and propositions which contribute to a clarification of the ambiguous nature of the IT-business value in international B2B relationship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

On the basis of empirical research, some questioned the assumed benefits of the science park model, whereas others reported positive outcomes. As a result, mixed findings regarding the benefits of science parks for firms can be observed. An important criterion in analyzing the effects of science parks is the level of networking as science parks often are regarded as a perfect location for interorganizational knowledge exchange and collaboration. Different levels and types of networking could be one of the explanations for these mixed findings. The literature on networks mainly stresses the benefits of networking in general, and networking between firms located on science parks in particular. This paper proposes that networks can have both positive and negative effects for firms located on science parks. The aim of this study is to theoretically explore the impacts of networking on innovative performace of on-park and off- park firms. A conceptual model is developed including the main and interaction effects of various aspects of inter-organizational networks on innovative performance. Absorptive capacity is also included in the model to account for firm-specific abilities. © 2008 PICMET."

It reveals an organizational frame of a lack of large R&D departments and a lack of global networks of subsidiaries or partners through which firms access creative knowledge. None of these classical ways to enhance creativity is present. Instead, creativity relies on distributed and independent communities of knowing which generate, exploit, and develop a 'creative slack' as a source of growth for the firm. These communities find their source of inspiration and innovation in the fertile soil of a creative city. © Oxford University Press 2008. All rights reserved."

Based on an empirical study of the TAMA cluster project (in the western part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area), which is a model project of the 'Industrial Cluster Plan' in Japan, we examine the intermediation effect of the TAMA Association and the 'absorptive capacity' of various product-developing SMEs. These two elements are interrelated because the participation of the product-developing SMEs is a prerequisite for the effective functioning of an intermediary such as the TAMA Association. Our analysis also shows that university-industry linkages and inter-firm linkages lead to different outcomes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Moreover, managerial ties are apt to interact with absorptive capacity to facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation. This paper examines the joint influence of managerial ties and absorptive capacity in two communities in China, one characterized by a high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the other consisting mainly of local corporations. We find that absorptive capacity moderates the effect of managerial ties on a corporation's innovativeness. Furthermore, when examining the two communities separately, we find that business ties and university ties have opposite effects. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The results show that access to knowledge through networking and cooperation is of utmost importance for innovative activity in the KIBS sector. Access to knowledge from universities and research institutions is particularly important for radical innovation, notwithstanding the degree of formality of cooperation. In contrast, access to knowledge from clients or suppliers only has a significant impact on the probability to innovate if the cooperation with these partners is based on formal cooperation via joint projects or formal cooperation contracts. Furthermore, we find empirical evidence for a positive correlation between KIBS firms and clients from the manufacturing sector: these stimulate in particular incremental, but also radical innovation."

Most are centered on the recipient team, and very few consider the effects of the source team knowledge characteristics on the knowledge absorption and the NPD performance. This paper analyzes the type of the external knowledge sourced from outside the organization and the process through which it is used by the recipient firm and the effect on NPD performance. This is done through a specific type of source team knowledge, the design, and through the NPD process in industries (clothing and construction) where it plays a key role. NPD cases were analyzed and clustered in three categories of design absorption processes. From these categories, a conceptual framework of the source-recipient knowledge complementarity and its impact on the NPD performance is proposed. The main result is that the complementarity between the recipient and the source knowledge is a critical aspect of the absorption process and therefore of the NPD performance. From a managerial perspective, this research highlights the role of design in the NPD process and how the combination of design knowledge with prior knowledge (marketing or technological) is related to NPD performance. © 2008 Product Development & Management Association."

We suggest that absorptive capacity is determined not only by research and development activities, but also by a set of internal factors, which we group into three basic categories: organizational knowledge, formalization, and social integration mechanisms. In addition, we suggest that these factors may influence all components of the firm's absorptive capacity, and that the influence can be positive or negative depending on the applicability of the knowledge being absorbed. This paper thus advances the understanding of absorptive capacity by exploring a largely ignored aspect in the literature: the role of knowledge attributes. We show how the model can be operationalized and empirically tested and provide preliminary evidence supporting most of the propositions in the analytical model. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Thus, interorganizational relations may be regarded as an extended knowledge base to which a firm has privileged access. We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, learning, and dynamic capabilities to analyze knowledge retention outside a firm's boundaries. Prior research into knowledge management has focused on internally storing knowledge, whereas research into knowledge transactions has primarily studied the internalization of external knowledge. The need to dynamically manage knowledge in interfirm relations over time - without necessarily internalizing this knowledge - has been relatively neglected. Therefore, we develop the foundations of the dynamic capability-based concept of relative capacity as a complement to absorptive capacity and transformative capacity in external knowledge retention. Relative capacity contributes to explaining interfirm differences in knowledge strategies, alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, open innovation, and performance. To guide further research, propositions are advanced regarding the antecedents and consequences of relative capacity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Building on research on institutions in emerging economies and the resource-based perspective in strategic management, we propose a model to explain how resource poor latecomer firms in emerging economies catch up with the multinational incumbents. We classify latecomers based on their strategic learning intent as either emulators or blind imitators. The strategic learning intent depends on a firm's complementary assets and its absorptive capacity. Firms that choose emulation develop flexible routines, while firms that choose blind imitation end up with rigid routines. Over time, when there is a need for resource renewal, firms that have flexible routines are better positioned to respond. We take the Chinese mobile phone industry as an exemplar to illustrate the core issues in latecomer catching up of emerging economy firms. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Specialist knowledge providers are consultancies, private research organisations and the public science-base (i.e., universities and the government research laboratories). These may be engaged by firms in co-operative arrangement for innovation or as informal sources of information. We find, as anticipated, that amongst other factors specialist knowledge providers are more likely to be engaged by firms with more open approaches to innovation, those with high levels of absorptive capacity, those with greater social capital and networking capabilities, as well as by those with deeper commitments to innovation. Overall, the use of specialist knowledge providers tends to complement firms' own internal innovation activities and to complement other external sources of knowledge. Moreover, the individual types of specialist knowledge providers tend to complement rather than substitute for one another. Beyond this we find significant differences in the types of specialist knowledge providers used by manufacturing and service firms. Although service firms are more likely than manufacturers to use specialist knowledge providers, they are more likely to engage consultants, whilst their links with research-based organisations, including the public science-base, are weaker. We ask whether there is a case for increasing the extent to which the public science-base undertakes activities that are relevant to innovation in the services. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study introduces the notion of alliance portfolio internationalization (API), which refers to the degree of foreignness of partners in a firm's collection of immediate alliance relationships. We develop a framework to explain how API impacts firm performance. We suggest that as a firm's API increases, financial performance is expected to initially decline, then improve, and finally decline again. This sigmoid relationship between API and financial performance is ascribed to evolving learning effects that shape the net benefits of API. When the firm's alliance portfolio, on average, consists of proximate foreign partners, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences, but at moderate levels of API, its absorptive capacity and specialized collaborative routines support the exchange of valuable network resources. Nevertheless, high levels of API undermine firm performance because of the failure of collaborative routines and mounting liabilities of cross-national differences. We test the framework using data on the alliance portfolios of U.S.-based software firms from 1990 to 2001. The results provide support for the sigmoid relationship as well as for our predictions that firms, which have gained experience with foreign partners and maintained wholly owned subsidiaries in their partners' countries of origin, can overcome some of the liabilities of API and better leverage its benefits. © 2008 INFORMS."

Drawing from two viewpoints of organizational learning, absorptive capacity and organizational improvisation, we examine whether experience with corporate restructuring modes (sell-offs, spin-offs) influences subsequent restructuring and financial performance. Consistent with an absorptive capacity view, cumulative and repetitive experience with sell-offs was related to the adoption of an ensuing sell-off and to higher performance. Conversely, and consistent with an organizational improvisation view, short-term and contemporaneous experience with spin-offs was related to the subsequent use of spin-offs and to increases in financial performance. The findings contribute to a dynamic explanation of corporate restructuring and its influence on financial performance, illustrate differences between learning in a repetitive situation and learning when repetition is rare, and indicate when absorptive capacity and organizational improvisational views are most profitable. Overall, these findings show that different kinds of restructuring experiences were associated with different modes of restructuring and performance records. Considered collectively, the organizational learning perspective offers insights into why some corporate restructuring strategies appear as intentional and deliberate actions while others resemble more spontaneous and simultaneous responses.

"Explaining variations in client extra costs between software projects offshored to India","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-41049097709&partnerID=40&md5=ff7bda925c55d09d6927dc6a9e4ae2a4","Gaining economic benefits from substantially lower labor costs has been reported as a major reason for offshoring labor-intensive information systems services to low-wage countries. However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects? This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects. The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects. The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors. A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context. The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution. The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs postcontractual extra costs for four types of activities: (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination. In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed. Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure. Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects. Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects. Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs. Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect)."

The analysis is based on a sample of 6094 manufacturing firms, taken from the Spanish Survey of Technological Innovation 2000. The results indicate that the firm's technological competences, derived from in-house R&D, are the main determinant of product innovation. They also suggest that in the presence of high levels of such competences, the technological opportunities deriving from non-industry agents become less important as determinants of innovation. We show that the determinants of innovation vary depending on the industrial sector and the degree of novelty of the product developed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It indicated that the main composition of the suspended matter was goethite (α-FeOOH). Batch adsorption isotherm experiments of pentachlorophenol (PCP) on the suspended matter were carried out in this paper. Furthermore, the effects of the pH value, ionic strength and the anionic surfactant Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (Las) on the adsorption behaviors of PCP were also researched The results indicated that the adsorption characteristics of PCP on the suspended matter followed Freundlich isotherm equation. It needed 2.5 hours to reach balance of absorption, and the absorptive capacity became the maxium when the pH value was 6."

Academy of Management Review 2002;27:185-203] to empirically explore the antecedents of potential absorptive capacity (PAC), i.e. the ability to identify and assimilate external knowledge flows. Based on a sample of 2464 innovative Spanish firms, we find evidence that R&D cooperation, external knowledge acquisition and experience with knowledge search are key antecedents of a firm's PAC. Also, during periods of important internal reshaping, when there are significant changes in strategy, design of the organization and marketing, firms exert more effort to accumulate PAC. Finally, we find that PAC is a source of competitive advantage in innovation, especially in the presence of efficient internal knowledge flows that help reduce the distance between potential and realized capacity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Exploration and exploitation: The interplay between knowledge and continuous innovation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-43049137384&doi=10.1504%2fIJTM.2008.018058&partnerID=40&md5=a2b412c651c50dd343a3a588b5e534da","In rapidly changing environments, organisations require dynamic capabilities to integrate, build and reconfigure resources and competencies to achieve continuous innovation. Although tangible resources are important to promoting the firm's ability to act, capabilities fundamentally rest in the knowledge created and accumulated by the firm through human capital, organisational routines, processes, practices and norms. The exploration for new ideas, technologies and knowledge - to one side - and - on the other one - the exploitation of existing and new knowledge is essential for continuous innovation. Firms need to decide how best to allocate their scarce resources for both activities and at the same time build dynamic capabilities to keep up with changing market conditions. This in turn, is influenced by the absorptive capacity of the firm to assimilate knowledge. This paper presents a case study that investigates the sources of knowledge in an engineering firm in Australia, and how it is organised and processed. As information pervades the firm from both internal and external sources, individuals integrate knowledge using both exploration and exploitation approaches. The findings illustrate that absorptive capacity can encourage greater leverage for exploration potential leading to radical innovation; and reconfiguring exploitable knowledge for incremental improvements. This study provides an insight for managers in quest of improving knowledge strategies and continuous innovation. It also makes significant theoretical contributions to the literature through extending the concepts of absorptive capacity and how knowledge constructs capabilities for innovation.

Knowledge-based resources allow organisations to adapt products and services to the marketplace and deal with competitive challenges that enable them to compete more effectively. One factor critical to using knowledge-based resources is the ability to transfer knowledge as a dimension of the learning organisation. There are many elements that may influence whether knowledge transfer can be effectively achieved in an organisation such as leadership, problem-solving behaviours, support structures, change management capabilities, absorptive capacity and the nature of the knowledge. An existing framework was applied in a case study to explain how knowledge transfer can be managed effectively and to identify emerging issues or additional factors involved in the process. As a result, a refined framework is proposed that provides a better understanding for the effective management of knowledge transfer processes that can provide a competitive advantage.

The goal is to understand whether Turkish firms collaborate for innovation or not and, if they do, what is the impact of partnerships on the innovation performance of firms? Design/methodology/approach - In this research, a survey methodology is employed. The questionnaire is implemented through structured interviews conducted with 135 Turkish companies from the textile, chemical, food and machinery industries. Findings - The findings show that Turkish firms have high-collaboration ties with other companies in particular but the existing partnerships have a weak impact on innovation performance. Research limitations/implications - As only one country is studied and data come from one year, the findings of this study are limited in terms of generalizing the results for a wide variety of developing countries. Practical implications - Non-materialized performance is to a degree due to low quality of relationships, but more importantly Turkish firms need to find ways to improve their partnerships and in-house capabilities, particularly their absorptive capacities, if they want to improve their innovativeness through partnerships. Originality/value - This paper is one of the early examples empirically investigating the relationship between technology collaborations and innovation performance of firms in a developing country context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Several authors have emphasized the added value of alliance relationships in the knowledge development and learning processes of organizations. Over the past decades, thanks to the opportunities provided by the inter-firm co-operations for knowledge transfer, knowledge access and learning, strategic alliances have become one of the most useful organizational forms for developing new knowledge for firms. The purpose of this paper is to identify and classify factors affecting knowledge transfer in strategic alliances. Design/methodology/approach - First, knowledge-related issues in strategic alliance literature are reviewed. Second, the importance of recognizing factors affecting knowledge transfer through strategic alliances is considered. Finally, the paper suggests a classification of factors in a bibliographical manner, which should be considered by researchers in related academic researches and also by alliance managers involved in planning and executing inter-firm alliances. Findings - Four categories are distinguished: the characteristics of knowledge; the factors related to absorptive capacity; the reciprocal behavior of the partners; and finally, the nature and form of alliance activity. Originality/value - The findings of this paper can help researchers to step forward in considering knowledge transfer in different typologies of alliances, because factors affecting knowledge transfer have varied effects on different types of alliances. Awareness of the existence of these factors is another contribution of this paper that helps practitioners analyze more attentively available options for decision-making and their consequences."

We adapted the absorptive capacity concept to individuals engaged in IT enabled engineering work, which is a situated and emergent phenomenon that requires individuals to posses or develop ability to acquire new task and computer knowledge; use or develop analytical and intuitive problem solving skills to assimilate and integrate these two types of knowledge; and apply them to their work. A model was developed linking the absorptive capacity of individuals, through enhanced IT utilization for problem solving/decision support, to task innovation and productivity. It was tested using a sample of 208 engineers using computers in their work. The results suggested that using IT innovatively and productively in such a work environment requires a mix of task knowledge, computer knowledge, and problem solving modalities. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It was anticipated that some web-based tools used previously by larger firms could be adapted, but limits in the capabilities of the participant firms and the emergence of a different business model led to a change in approach. Participants had quite diverse internal ICT capabilities that might be used for bidding collaboratively for manufacturing contracts, or for operating as an extended enterprise. Some way of mapping the functional project needs and comparing these with participant capabilities was needed. In this paper an adaptation of the notion of absorptive capacity where both a firm's resource base and its knowledge base are considered is used as a framework to better understand participant requirements. This was subsequently used in building a web-based virtual enterprise support system that utilized simple, lowest cost system components."

However, despite the fact that it has been around for some time, DW has experienced limited spread/use and relatively high failure rates. Treating DW as a major IT infrastructural innovation, we propose a comprehensive research model - grounded in IT adoption and organizational theories - that examines the impact of various organizational and technological (innovation) factors on DW adoption. Seven factors - five organizational and two technological - are tested in the model. The study employed rigorous measurement scales of the research variables to develop a survey instrument and targeted 2500 organizations in both manufacturing and services segments within two major states in the United States. A total of 196 firms (276 executives), of which nearly 55% were adopters, responded to the survey. The results from a logistic regression model, initially conceptualizing a direct effect of each of the seven variables on adoption, indicate that five of the seven variables (three organizational factors - commitment, size, and absorptive capacity - and two innovation characteristics - relative advantage and low complexity) are key determinants of DW adoption. Although scope for DW and preexisting data environment within the organization were favorable for adopter firms, they did not emerge as key determinants. However, the study provided an opportunity to explore a more complex set of relationships. This alternative structural model (using LISREL) provides a much richer explanation of the relationships among the antecedent variables and with adoption, the dependent variable. The study, especially the revised conceptualization, contributes to existing research by proposing and empirically testing a fairly comprehensive model of organizational adoption of an information technology (IT) innovation, more specifically a DSS technology. The findings of the study have interesting implications with respect to IT/DW adoption, both for researchers and practitioners. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Drawing on detailed case studies of three IT services multinationals and 10 IT outsourcing contracts in Argentina and Brazil, the paper argues that forward linkages depend on both a particular feature of client firm absorptive capacity-namely the expertise of client firm managers in designing and operating IT outsourcing contracts-and the type of global strategy of IT services suppliers and their client firms. The effect of both these factors, however, is in turn influenced by institutional and economic features of the host economy. The evidence suggests that IT services firms move between countries not only their own operations, but also the execution of contracts with client firms. These practices relocate client firms' outsourcing from subsidiaries of IT firms within the same national economy to subsidiaries located outside it, in turn facilitating consolidation and regionalisation of business segments of (multinational) client firms and thereby potentially reducing the economic contribution of client firms to the host economy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper wants to answer the question whether an incentive system yields a successfully regulation of absorptive capacity. We therefore review the concept of absorptive capacity, its different interpretations in business research, its enhancement and points of criticism and derive four objectives conceptually.

It suggests that (a) the assessment of spillovers calls upon a detailed analysis of these effects according to the mechanisms by which they occur (viz. the increase of competition, demonstration effects, and worker mobility), and (b) spillovers depend on the interaction between their mechanisms and the levels of domestic absorptive capacity. Results are affirmative in that high-technology firms benefit from FDI heightening competition, while mid-technology firms benefit from demonstration effects. And low-technology firms, which are not able to benefit from foreign affiliates via demonstration effects alone, manage to reap the benefit via the recruitment of MNCs labor. In addition, only firms which largely invest in absorbing foreign technology benefit from spillovers. Copyright © 2008 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Findings from diffusion analysis are presented in the form of 10 stylised facts, helping the reader to see the forest for the trees. The overall conclusion is that the diffusion of clean technology (same as the diffusion of normal innovations) is governed by endogenous mechanism (epidemic learning and learning economies) and by exogenous mechanisms. Policy is important for clean technology diffusion but other factors are important too: the characteristics of the clean technology, absorptive capacities of potential adopters and the age structure of capital. It is often overlooked that companies have a choice: they can choose between an end-of-pipe solution, a process change (adaptation) and a change of process (substitution). This means that the diffusion and evolution of one clean technology will be at the expense of the diffusion of another clean technology, something overlooked in studies on clean technology diffusion. Further research is needed on the influence of public policy on clean technology choice, expectations (about learning economies and prices), adjustment costs, network externalities and complementary innovations on clean technology adoption choices. © 2007."

The evolving global business environment necessitates that organizations shift from a rigid, standardized competitive approach to a more flexible mobilization of human resources located both inside and outside the company. This can be aided by recognizing knowledge worker capabilities as a hierarchy from acquired knowledge to more complex unique and creative knowledge. Competitive advantage can be gained by moving individual and cumulative capabilities higher on this pyramid. © 2008 Industrial Research Institute, Inc."

The purpose of this paper is to use bibliometric techniques to examine R&D Management in four time periods, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2005 in order to reveal changes in its intellectual base. Bibliometric research has illuminated the knowledge domains of several technology and innovation management journals including R&D Management Linton and Thongpapanl, but there has not previously been a comprehensive detailed analysis focused only on R&D Management. Using co-citation analysis, this paper identifies the invisible colleges (research networks) associated with publications in R&D Management. The results indicate that Cohen and Levinthal's absorptive capacity model dominates the final two periods. The conclusions suggest how the absorptive capacity model might be more effectively utilized in future R&D Management research. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
"An adoption of semantic web from the perspective of technology innovation - A qualitative research approach","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896257981&partnerID=40&md5=74eba6e6ca91a887373c6341121154a3","What factors affect the adoption and diffusion of Semantic Web innovation? This paper answers this question using multiple case studies. The case study as a qualitative approach is appropriate to achieve this, because the Semantic Web is at the early introduction stage. Data was gathered from seven out of nine organizations adopting the Semantic Web in Korea. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Three factors affecting adoption of the Semantic Web were identified. The first factor is demand pull including requirements for solving search and integration problems of the existing systems and for creating new services. Second, environmental conduciveness, potential business value, government sponsorship programs, and active roles of suppliers affect the adoption of the Semantic Web from the perspective of technology push. Finally, absorptive capacity is an important role of the adoption. Four propositions are derived from this case study."

Many earlier studies argue that local knowledge spillovers is the main factors that influence innovative performance of firms operating within high-tech industry cluster, at the same time, absorptive capacity are also important. This paper investigates how a firm's absorptive capacity (ACAP) mediates the impact of knowledge spillovers on innovation performance of firms operating within high-tech industry cluster. Our basic hypothesis is that those firms with higher absorptive capacity, not only identify more knowledge spillovers; they are also able to manage them more efficiently, and ultimately transform them into innovative outcome. The date comes from questionnaires of 102 firms in Changchun software industry cluster in China. As a result of this study, we do find empirical support that absorptive capacity mediates the impact of knowledge spillover on innovative performance of firms within high-tech industry cluster."

To fulfill the purpose of providing a systematic literature review, selections of existing empirical studies and literature studies have been organized on the basis of the following three dimensions: (1) science parks; (2) networks; and (3) absorptive capacity. In the proposed conceptual model, networking is broken down into formal and informal networks, which are defined further in terms of relational embeddedness and structural embeddedness. Absorptive capacity is included in the model to account for firm-specific factors influencing innovativeness. The reason is that absorptive capacity influences firm ability to translate information from the networks into its own innovation activities. Science parks, closely associated with cluster structures, also have an influence on Arm innovative performance due to geographic proximity where common knowledge is augmented and reinforced. This paper shows the importance of examing science park effects in greater detail, clearly showing networking, absorptive capacity and cluster mechanisms that drive firm innovative performance. © 2007 IEEE."

Using data of manufacturing firms, this paper confirm the hypothesis that local firm's potential absorptive capacity can contribute to its knowledge acquisition in GMN, and the hypothesis of the moderating effect of network embeddedness is partially supported by results for the reason that only information sharing and joint problem solving (components of network embeddedness) have moderating effect on the association between potential absorptive capacity and local firm's knowledge acquisition."

We study a wide range of manufacturing and service industries, not just high-tech, and a wide range of innovation activities, not just R&D. We use multilevel logit models for complex samples to disentangle industry from firm-specific effects. We find that within an industry, firms that invest in appropriation instruments to reduce outgoing spillovers tend to conduct more R&D and downstream activities than firms that do not. Acquisition of technology is not related to the use of appropriation instruments. The effects of incoming spillovers (measured through absorptive capacity) on innovation activities of firms are industry specific and stronger for firms that invest in appropriation instruments. For this type of firm, both the capability to scan the external environment for technology and the capability to integrate new technology are related to the innovation activities. For firms that do not invest in appropriation instruments, only scanning capabilities are related. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The results showed a highly significant relationship between purchasing's maturity level and cost-reduction results. Somewhat counter-intuitively, larger saving potential was identified in more developed firms. This finding may be explained by a new concept called ""purchasing absorptive capacity"".

However, in general technology spillover effect of FDI is more significant than import since their technology spillover mechanism differs essentially, and also technology spillover effects greatly depend on absorptive capability, which is measured by both degree of openness and human capital accumulation."

The application of cognitive HRM practices enhances the ability of knowledge receivers to absorb transferred knowledge, while the use of stimulative HRM practices increases their motivation. Temporary and permanent types of international assignments respectively influence the ability and motivation of expatriate managers to share their knowledge. © 2008, IGI Global."

However, explanations of unrelated diversification have been less than clear. A conceptual model of unrelated diversification is thus proposed. In drawing on Penrose's (1959) resource based approach, unrelated diversification is explained by an organization's 'three pillars', which consist of its strength of dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity, and weak ties. The role of the three pillars is to discover new resource applications or uses in conditions of market failure that are characterized by 'incomplete' markets. A novel feature of this model is that an organization can diversify more broadly than predicted by Penrose (1959) and other modern resource-based approaches (Teece et al., 1997). Furthermore, unrelated diversification can be beneficial. This study also offers suggestions to measure the three pillars; its contributions and implications are discussed as well. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007."

Findings - Explains how top managers firstly, break with administrative heritage to increase absorptive capacity and secondly, leverage administrative heritage for rapid implementation of change. Intra- and cross-case analyses demonstrate that absorptive capacity increases and organisational change occurs where the top management team has radically different skills and mindsets from the dominant logic of the post-Soviet organisation, an entrepreneurial orientation and the capability to drive through change due to a top-down management style. Research limitations/implications - The research is restricted to four case studies. However, the critical success factors identified could apply to any large, conservative and bureaucratic organisation undergoing change. This represents an interesting avenue for research on organisational turnaround in the West. Practical implications - An understanding of the critical success factors for dealing with administrative heritage will assist managers in transition economies and in turnaround situations in the West. Originality/value - The speed of change in the Russian oil industry provided a unique setting for research into organisational change in transition economies. On the basis of cross-case analyses, a new theoretical framework was developed to explain the change process."

One possible source of innovative ideas are new employees. Based on an existing game-theoretic model the conditions of efficient knowledge transfer in a team are analyzed. Offering knowledge to a colleague cannot be controlled directly by the company due to information asymmetries. Thus the management has to provide incentives, which motivate the employees to act in favor of the company. The aim of this paper is to show what influences the propensity of the employees to engage in knowledge transfer and how the management can design the incentive structure for optimal transfer. Several factors are relevant, especially the individual costs of participating in the transfer. These consist mainly of the existing absorptive capacity and the working atmosphere. The model is at least partly generalized on more players. The relevance of the adequate team size is shown: too few or too many developers decrease the remaining company profit. A further result is that depending on the cost structure, perfect knowledge transfer is not always best for the profit of the company. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved."

We find that faculty with tenure are more likely to engage in such activity, thus providing suggestive evidence of an externality associated with permanent employment. We also find that older faculty are more likely to engage with industry, to a point, holding tenure constant. Tenure and age proxy, respectively, what we call the ""accumulated advantage"" of faculty and their absorptive capacity. Because faculty patenting with industry involved both parties, our findings reflect that such faculty experience and expertise are important to industry to enter into a patenting relationship.

This question is especially relevant at regional level, as those faculty members who do interact with industry may show a preference for firms that are larger and technologically superior to those in the region. Most analysts, however, have tended to focus on the national level, particularly on those countries at the forefront of technological innovation. In the absence of any formal theory, we propose a two-step method to formulate the hypothesis that only selected faculty members interact with selected firms. First, we identify the type of faculty member who interacts with firms. Second, we examine whether this type of faculty member interacts with every type of firm. A test sample is drawn from the Valencian Community of Spain, a region with low absorptive capacity, where firms may show undesirable properties for university interaction. The results allow us to challenge the view that certain individual universities may show a higher propensity for interaction once we take into account differences between the individual characteristics of their faculty members. We also claim that in a region like the Valencian Community, faculty members who usually participate in contracts (male, holding an administrative position) do so mainly with larger firms, but not with firms from their own region, where they find lower technological standards.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review of the literature on knowledge transfer, systems thinking and social construction leads to the proposal of a new KT paradigm. Findings - The Dynamic Knowledge Transfer Capacity model (DKTC) found in this paper identifies the components required for social systems to generate, disseminate and use new knowledge to meet their needs. The model includes pre-existing conditions, (need and prior knowledge) and four categories of capacities (generative, disseminative, absorptive and adaptive/responsive) that social systems must possess for KT to take place. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that the DKTC model is particularly well suited to analyzing complex systems with multiple stakeholders as opposed to small-scale knowledge transfer systems. Empirical analysis in complex systems environments will help verify, enrich and generalize the model. Practical implications - The paper sees that in an increasingly knowledge-based economy, the ability to base decisions on the latest knowledge is vital for the success of organizations. The capacity for effective and sustained exchange between a system's stakeholders (researchers, government, practitioners, etc.); exchanges characterized by significant interactions reflected within the DKTC model, results in the appropriate use of the most recent discoveries in the decision making process. Originality/value - The paper proposes a new knowledge transfer paradigm that views knowledge as a systemic, socially constructed, context-specific representation of reality. The proposed knowledge transfer model is in sharp contrast to past attempts, focusing attention on the capacities that must be present in organizations and social systems as a precondition for knowledge transfer to occur."

The main reason is that the implementation of consulting projects is likely to be connected with an intensive knowledge transfer from developed to emerging markets. Training of local employees and cooperation with local firms are necessary elements to make the transfer effective. The empirical statistics shows training and cooperation to be more frequent in consulting projects financed by DAs as compared to commercial projects. According to theory and experience, training should be included in projects in the least developed host countries, whereas local cooperation should be more frequent, the higher is the development level of the host country. However, DAs do not follow these rules of thumb in a convincing way.

The key finding is that the hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped effect of cognitive distance on innovation performance of firms is confirmed. Moreover, as expected, we found that the positive effect for firms is much higher when engaging in more radical, exploratory alliances than in more exploitative alliances. The effect of cumulative R&D turns out to be mixed. It appears to increase absorptive capacity, as expected, but there is clear evidence that it also reduces the effect of cognitive distance on novelty value, making it increasingly difficult to find additional novelty. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Using a novel measure of alliance performance, that is, joint patents, this study aims to tackle this question. Our results from the global pharmaceutical industry show that joint invention has an inverted U-shape relationship with a path-dependent technology base, with the level of joint patents initially increasing and then decreasing beyond a certain level of path dependence. The results also show that joint patents are more numerous when the alliance partners have had prior ties with each other. Overall, the finding suggests that creating new technology through alliances can be facilitated by ensuring the positive side of absorptive capacity, while avoiding its downside. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about how absorptive capacity - the firm's ability to acquire, assimilate, and use new knowledge - effects innovation in new firms. We build on extant conceptual arguments from scholars who assert that the concept of absorptive capacity can be delineated into a number of individual components, and we test the influences of each component on innovation using a sample of new firms in the Swedish telecom, IT, media, and entertainment sectors. We find that while all of the components of absorptive capacity influence innovation in new ventures, acquiring new technological knowledge and employing mechanisms for exploiting new knowledge have the greatest effects. Our results provide a direct empirical test of the linkage between absorptive capacity and innovation, and suggest that the effects of these components of absorptive capacity on performance are more complex than previously articulated in the literature. We conclude with implications for future research surrounding absorptive capacity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Sustained absorption and domestic usability of transgenic varieties depend on constellation of: human capital-induced absorptive capacity, governance, and structural congruence between source and recipients contingent on technology infrastructure and socio-institutional parameters. Such innovations result in higher production, welfare and global trade. Also, concomitant 4% exogenous productivity shock in information technology along with 5% productivity growth in the agro-biotech sectors further enhances such simulated impacts on global production and welfare.

A secondary purpose is to evaluate the fit, suitability and applicability to this topic. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review on subsidiary learning and knowledge transfer in International Business and Economic Geography was conducted following an explorative design. Through a survey of articles on subsidiary learning sources, barriers, and the required mechanisms were identified. Some underlying theoretical contributions were also surveyed to better capture core constructs. Findings - Motivation, knowledge, absorptive capacity, and role of the subsidiary influence on learning, and the more embedded the subsidiary the better for performance. Furthermore, more advanced economies are expected to create more valuable knowledge, and knowledge flows therefore from advanced to transition economies. The more value-chain activities that are carried out, a greater flow of knowledge flow is expected. Not much research is conducted on the value of the knowledge flows. Subsidiary learning is not studied in transition economies by economic geographers, or international business researchers. Subsidiary learning is not studied in transition economies by economic geographers, or international business researchers. Research limitations/implications - Little knowledge exists on knowledge flows from subsidiaries in transition economies, to multinational corporation (MNC') entities in developed economies. Mapping of ongoing relations through the lenses of business networks may be one viable way to capture evolution and change in the role of subsidiaries, or it could be mapped through analysis of evolution and change in the routines between dyads in the MNC. Practical implications - MNCs may overlook learning opportunities due to biases in literature. Knowledge management and formal and informal integrative mechanisms for knowledge transfer may be as important in transition - as in developed economies. As Western firms continue to offshore critical activities to transition economies, they should explore the learning opportunities for organisational learning and improved strategic performance. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in questioning the conventional knowledge on learning and knowledge transfer which is most often researched in developed economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Our case study of the Barletta footwear district in the South of Italy suggests otherwise. Based on social network analysis, we demonstrate that the local knowledge network is quite weak and unevenly distributed among the local firms. A strong local network position of a firm tended to increase their innovative performance, and so did their connectivity to extra-local firms. So, it mattered being connected either locally or non-locally: being co-located was surely not enough. Having a high absorptive capacity seemed to raise only indirectly, through non-local relationships, the innovative performance of firms."

While transforming knowledge into products and processes it is exploited commercially. Nevertheless, the existing knowledge stock and the absorptive capacity of actors like employees at firms and researchers at universities and research institutions are conditional for the ability to produce, identify, and exploit knowledge. Since incumbent firms do not exploit new knowledge to the full extent, realized entrepreneurial opportunities may arise. This paper tests the hypothesis whether or not entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for knowledge flows and economic growth. The empirical results indicate that an increase in innovative start-up activity is more effective than an increase in general entrepreneurship for economic growth. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007."

Our aim is to deepen and extend resource-level theorizing about sustainable competitive advantage. Our analysis formalizes the notion of barriers to imitation, particularly those based on time compression diseconomies where the faster a firm develops a resource, the greater the cost. Time compression diseconomies are derived from a micromodel of resource development with diminishing returns to effort. We use a continuous time model of the flows of development costs and market revenues, which allows us to integrate strategic and financial analyses of firm investment problems. We examine two dimensions of sustainability: whether the resources underlying a firm's competitive advantage are economically imitable and, if so, how long imitation takes. Surprisingly, we show that sustainable competitive advantage does not necessarily lead to superior performance. We find that imitators sometimes benefit from reductions in their absorptive capacity and that innovators should license either all or none of their knowledge. Despite recent criticisms, we reaffirm the usefulness of a resource level of analysis for strategy research, especially when the focus is on resources developed through internal projects with identifiable stopping times. ©2007 INFORMS."

This study also investigates whether successful implementation of best practices leads to operational performance improvement. Design/methodology/approach - A survey research based on 55 MBP was conducted. Regression analysis was employed to test the proposed relationships. Findings - Codification, compatibility and innovativeness of organizational culture were found to have an impact on implementation success. On the other hand, complexity, absorptive capacity, external support and the existence of champion were not emerged as the determinants of implementation. It was also found that successful implementation would lead to operational performance improvement. Research limitations/implications - The sample size is a limitation to this study. Practical implications - Knowing the significant determinants of implementation success, practitioners will make a better selection among competing MBP. Also, practitioners will also be able to utilize their resources better, because they will know what they should look for in each benchmarking visit. A positive significant relationship between the implementation success and performance indicated that benchmarking is an effective technique. Originality/value - This study is the first to explore pre adoption factors that may have an influence on the implementation of MBP. Davies and Kochhar reported that studies of relationships between MBP and performance in the area of manufacturing are limited.

However, this question, with its rather instrumental rationality, may underestimate another key issue: the ability of companies to create value that can be captured from customers. This paper reports on three companies in the automotive industry developing and launching cars with improved eco-environmental performance and less petrol consumption. The study reveals that, despite being captured in the same technological paradigm, the individual company's mode of environmental interpretation and its aspiration to exploit new technology may be two important explanatory factors in its ability to go green profitably. The study indicates that an enacting mode of environmental interpretation may be superior to a discovering mode, and suggests that for companies having a discovering mode there may be a need to complement existing engineering practice with insights into consumer psychology, and bundling of common good versus private good product attributes. The research upon which this paper is based was conducted using an insider/outsider approach in studying the three companies. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment."

Recently, the assumptions underpinning the life-cycle perspective (growth is linear, sequential, deterministic and invariant) have been argued not to pertain to organizations. This paper reviews the literature on life-cycle growth models, traces the development of a growing sophistication of conceptualizing growth and highlights some of the limitations of the literature. The authors make a contribution by proposing an alternative conceptual framework for thinking about growing businesses. The framework consists of two dimensions. First, a typology of key issues that are likely to be faced by all growing firms, and the discussion is shaped by M. Gladwell's (The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. Boston: Little Brown, 2000) notion of 'tipping points'. The second dimension is developed by drawing on the knowledge management literature and the concept of absorptive capacity (Cohen, W.M. and Levinthal, D.A. (1990). Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation. Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 128-152). This concept is applied to a discussion of the state of an organization regarding its ability to absorb and use new knowledge. Further, it is suggested that the framework has value for both policy and practice and can be used for the design and specification of interventional support and, to identify and evaluate their impact. If interventions are to help firms to grow, they must provide the right knowledge or support in forms that the firm can utilize. Together, these two dimensions provide a framework to examine firm growth issues and to analyse the effectiveness of different interventions on firms in different states within this framework. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007."

This commentary reviews the contribution by Lyles and Salk, as reflected in the subsequent literature. The setting of the study in Hungary 1993 raises the challenging question of how this particular context may have influenced the research outcomes. I argue that the national context of radical environmental change and the organisational context of joint ventures incorporating privatised state firms crucially influence processes of organisational learning. The importance of context suggests modifying future research agendas in international business, and in organisational learning in particular. I thus suggest that future research should incorporate context more explicitly to establish boundary conditions for theory, and to develop managerially relevant insights. © 2007 Academy of International Business All rights reserved."

Findings - The results show a general consensus about the influence of different inter-firm relationships in acquiring external knowledge and a diversified knowledge structure for assimilating the acquired knowledge. The study also indicates some potential challenges and contradictions in managing inter-firm relationships and knowledge diversity as well as perceived barriers for future developments of absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications - Delphi survey is an empirical method subject to the limitation of testing or inductively building theoretical concepts. Practical implications - The results of the Delphi study are predominantly centred on policy implication and on informing strategic decision-making at manufacturing firms. Originality/value - This paper discusses one of the biggest Delphi surveys ever conducted in Europe. Its comprehensiveness increases the value of the results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

A rereading of the seminal Cohen and Levinthal (1990) article in light of current research on learning and innovation directs our attention to serious ambiguities and omissions in Zahra and George's reconceptualization. We suggest a reintroduction of ""recognizing the value,"" an alternative understanding of ""transformation,"" a clarification of ""potential absorptive capacity,"" an elaboration of the impact of socialization mechanisms, an investigation of the role of ""power relationships,"" and an inclusion of feedback loops in a dynamic model of absorptive capacity.

Given these particularities of industry convergence, this paper analyses decision processes at the front end of 54 R&D projects by using a mixed-method research design. Findings indicate that there are different approaches of how firms engage in innovation in industry convergence.

Using two case studies, we develop six testable propositions regarding how three of the established antecedents of knowledge transfer —absorptive capacity, shared identity and causal ambiguity—would be affected by the different characteristics, which define multi-organizational network form.

Seven gatekeepers (boundary-spanning individuals) from different organisations were interviewed about their experiences in facilitating knowledge transfer between a cross-sector working group and their organisation. The context for the research was the Pathfinder Project, a project based around the development and transfer of an emergent knowledge model for strategic management, Managing for Outcomes (MfO). A range of factors that facilitated knowledge transfer were identified. Among these, translation and interpretation activities were found to be critical to successful knowledge transfer. Gatekeepers reported acting as translator/interpreter, an essential role which demanded specialised skills. The nature of this role is outlined, with reference to a staged model for knowledge transfer that emerged from the research project. The translator/interpreter role required gatekeepers to engage in active and continuous conversion of knowledge to meet the differing needs of a range of recipients. This helped to increase the overall absorptive capacity of participating organisations. Implications of these findings for research and practice are outlined. © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach – To analyze the competitive balance implications of EHR networks on hospitals, the authors reviewed empirical, theoretical and practical literatures bearing on the problem. Findings – US hospitals are increasingly facing decisions regarding whether, when and how to participate in networks of EHRs. EHRs can replace paper-based medical records, improve the quality of patient care and decrease medical errors. EHRs also support product innovations such as e-visits and online prescribing. Such a significant innovation will alter the competitive standing of many hospitals, some favorably and others unfavorably. Hospitals with dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity and organizational designs that facilitate innovation will fair best. Practical implications – Hospitals can also utilize several strategies to increase their odds of improving their competitive positions as the industry adopts EHR networks. Examples include strategies involving new products, early entry into an EHR network, promotion of organizational learning, and management of social impacts of workflow changes.

However, only a little is known about the processes through which firms learn to know their customers organization-wide. In this article we propose that one possibility to study how firms process customer-related knowledge, and thus learn about and from their customers organization-wide, is to apply absorptive capacity construct originally developed in the context of innovation activities. By building on previous literature on absorptive capacity, customer knowledge management and relationship marketing, we introduce a conceptual framework of customer-related absorptive capacity, and discuss the external and internal antecedents to the construct. We propose that customer relationship performance could at least partly be explained by the capability of the supplier firm to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit customer-related knowledge."

Building on absorptive capacity and social network theory, I present and test a theoretical model to explain the differences in individuals' contributions to organizational innovativeness. The model is premised on the notion that innovation stems from the novel combination of different sources of knowledge and, as such, is the result of collective rather than individual efforts. Focusing on the type of knowledge internalized, by whom, and the interaction patterns through which it is applied to the generation of innovations I argue that both the structure of knowledge and the structure of social networks are critical aspects of the absorptive capacity process. Hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework are tested using original sociometric data collected from 276 scientists, researchers, and engineers from 16 R&D labs of a multinational semiconductor producer. Results indicate that knowledge sourced from outside the organization enhances individuals' contributions to organizational innovativeness. These benefits however, are contingent upon the type of external knowledge sourced by individuals and how similar or different this knowledge is to the knowledge available through their network of contacts inside the organization."

Research indicates that there are various sources of value that could derive from networks, such as cost and time efficiency, quality improvement, flexibility and innovation.

Little empirical research has focused on the real value that participating firms can appropriate and create. Based on an empirical study involving SMEs, this paper analyses the value that SMEs can create and/or appropriate by participating in networks and the extent to which value creation depends on factors such as absorptive capability and social capital. This study demonstrates that SMEs can create and appropriate a great deal of value when they become an integral part of network systems. However, factors such as absorptive capacity and social capital need to be taken into consideration, since they greatly impact and affect the capability of firms to create and appropriate value. It is argued that in order to create and appropriate value through networks, they need to emphasize knowledge assimilation and sharing as well as creating continuous learning capability."

This misalignment can be further complicated by competing approaches towards product modularisation, a re-distribution of engineering responsibilities and a limited understanding of the social and relational dimensions of knowledge integration in the context of systems integration.

It argues that local suppliers' responsiveness can be a supplementary condition to absorptive capacity when considering buyer-supplier relation of knowledge transfer. In Vietnam where local suppliers were less capable or limited, Honda has exploited the supplier responsiveness to develop external manufacturing capabilities which contributed to Honda Vietnam's performance. Responsiveness enabled Honda to use a hands-on approach as an effective mechanism to transfer key principles and tacit technical knowledge to local suppliers in the initial stages of establishing a relationship. As a result, Honda is both beneficial from suppliers' specific absorptive capacity and continuous responsiveness. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."

As discussed in Chap. 2, the latter involves a process of identifying, acquiring and using external knowledge. New product-developing small firms often need external knowledge due to the staff deficiencies and specialisation of these firms (see Chap. 1). In earlier chapters, it was shown that knowledge integration may be achieved by transferring explicit knowledge, and/or knowledge holders and that nurturing this process is important. This chapter shows that differences in knowledge and experience between a firm in need of external knowledge and the supplier of this knowledge are both a main source of advantage of knowledge transfer, as well as a barrier to successful transfer. It will be shown that, even if one knows which knowledge is needed, and where this knowledge is, an intensive process is needed to successfully implement external knowledge in an NPD process. The structure of the chapter follows this logic. The theoretical part (Sect. 9.2) shows that, considering the nature of knowledge and structures of networks especially in NPD processes, knowledge transfer involves methods of network management. The role of interaction in networks and the concept of absorptive capacity are described and ways to overcome these difficulties are outlined in the last part of the theory. The second part of the chapter (Sect. 9.3) describes the WAP case in which mechanisms of network-based knowledge transfer are illustrated.

Unlike the Triple Helix or the New Economics of Science that advocates a certain type (integration or separation) of university-industry relationship, we take a contingent or context-specific perspective on the relationship, having the context of developing countries in mind. The framework developed in this paper explains in what condition universities would keep distance from industry or become entrepreneurial to take a part in the functions of industry (i.e. setting up and running their own business enterprises). In this typology the basic determinants are internal resources of university, absorptive capacity of industrial firms and existence of intermediary institutions, as well as the propensity of university for UREs. The paper has argued that the Chinese universities since the market-oriented reform had strong propensity to pursue economic gains and strong internal (R&D and other) resources to launch start-ups, and thus established their own firms (i.e. UREs), given the low absorptive capacity of industrial firms and the underdeveloped intermediary institutions. The recent adjustment of the UREs in China can also be understood in terms of changes in the above three factors, such as universities' weakened propensity to pursue economic gains, relative decline of superiority of university resources, and improved external environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A current example of convergence can be witnessed in the nutraeeuticals and functional foods sector, emerging at the boundary between the food and pharmaceutical industries. Not only technologies blur, but there is also a convergence of demand structures: consumers try to satisfy different needs in one transaction. In this context, this paper explores how actors from different industry-specific resource backgrounds can engage in an innovative activity requiring new technological and marketing competences. Given that absorptive capacity is limited by existing competences, this paper asks how organizations with different R&D competences are able to seize opportunities for innovation emerging from convergence. Empirical findings based on primary data collected from 54 R&D projects of a nutraceutical cluster show that there are different approaches of front end decision making: while some firms follow existing processes for front end decision making, others leave existing paths and need partners to fill in gaps already identified at the front end of innovation. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Findings - There were significant age, educational and size effects that influence SME acquisition and assimilation of knowledge. Primarily, it is the small firms of 15+ employees that have the capacity to absorb and use new knowledge - especially those with higher educational levels and clear growth objectives. These firms are not startups but they do tend to be younger firms with younger founders. Practical implications - Given the main policy aim is the development of clusters and of knowledge-based firms, policy makers should focus on SMEs recently started by graduates or people with technical qualifications; educators need to develop technology and innovation management programmes for these firms.

Given its critical importance, excellence in renewal of technological base would serve as a dynamic capability. Drawing on past literature, we identify this dynamic capability associated with acquiring and utilizing external technological know-how with the notion of absorptive capacity (AC). We ask the following questions: (a) What would cause some firms to have a higher AC than others? and, (b) What is the impact of AC on a firm's profitability? We build a conceptual framework suggesting that marketing, R&D, and operations capabilities have a significant positive impact on a firm's AC. We test our framework on a data set of firms in high-technology markets. Using an econometric technique called stochastic frontier estimation, we infer the AC of firms from an observation of the know-how they actually absorb. We find that firm-specific capabilities significantly impact AC. Also, we find that AC has a significant impact on profitability and that this impact is moderated by the pace of technological change: the greater the pace of change, the greater the impact. ©2006 INFORMS."

"Institutional effects on the IT outsourcing market: Analysing clients, suppliers and staff transfer in Germany and the UK","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27744606399&doi=10.1177%2f0170840606064103&partnerID=40&md5=64afc5f0a19e58a44773e1df4c71f8f7","Drawing on empirical evidence in Germany and the UK, this article examines the institutional effects on a fast-growing area of knowledge-intensive business services - IT outsourcing. This is an important area for research since the IT outsourcing market provides many organizations with an important specialized production input and is characterized by complex inter-organizational relations. By exploring institutional influences in the context of IT outsourcing, the research extends earlier studies on how client-supplier relations shape markets for business services. It also contributes to varieties of capitalism debates by highlighting heterogeneous institutional effects within countries and common systemic trends (involving powerful multinational IT firms) in the development of the market for IT outsourcing. Comparative analysis of 13 IT outsourcing contracts in Germany and the UK, focusing on the organizational practices of client organizations and IT firms, illuminated institutional effects within the organizational setting. Analysis of industrylevel data shows that the diverse institutional contexts of Germany and the UK provided an equally favourable basis for growth in the IT outsourcing market, despite its apparent deregulatory bias. But significant institutional effects were observed, specifically related to: the role of deliberative institutions (especially works councils); and institutions governing technical standards and contracting rules. Strong deliberative institutions in Germany facilitated market growth since transactions involved distributive dilemmas, particularly related to staff transfer. Also, while institutions shaped technical and contractual expertise of client managers, they were not deterministic. Instead, they interacted with characteristics of the IT outsourcing market, namely: heterogeneous client practices to improve absorptive capacity; public vs. private contracting experience; and power relations between client and IT firm in their use of market discipline.

In the first part of this article the construct of value innovation is operationalized within the context of selected business-to-business markets. We report the results of an ongoing research project; starting from traditional ways of value creation, the study reveals different types of value innovation initiatives undertaken by industry participants. We observe, however, that networks, firms and managers are embedded in industry recipes. These recipes block the creation and realization of value innovation. Some firms are trying to break out of existing frames and their experiences pinpoint to specific ways of markets sensing, strategic marketing and different marketing-mix tools. As such, the research frames value innovation initiatives in the existing industry contexts and managerial frames, and identifies drivers, barriers and perceived success factors for the process of value innovation. The second part of the article then looks at the stages of value innovation and their impact on marketing, organizations and networks. Based on the data analysis, the paper posits propositions which stress the concept of ""multilevel absorptive capacity"". © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Technology transfer (TT) process that is knowledge driven demands a recipient industry with adequate capacity for absorbing new knowledge. International joint ventures and subcontracts employed in building material and construction can be serious vehicles of TT provided they contribute to providing higher quality inputs into the wider industry. These issues are examined through a survey of construction subcontracts during the period 1985-2002. The respondents indicated that moderately favourable conditions for TT existed in the completed projects. Nonetheless, the paper argues that negligible real productivity changes in construction in Sri Lanka in the recent decade point to stagnation in growth in local absorptive capacity. China in contrast has placed a balanced emphasis on upgrading building materials and equipment, design and construction, and built up an impressive absorptive capacity, with modernisation of the entire industry in prospect. The paper suggests advance planning for TT in foreign funded projects to ensure greater participation of local firms, together with a balanced focus on efficient and timely execution of projects, the profitability of participants, and realisation of TT goals."

Although there are many studies which present practical examples of how firms utilize the Internet to support their everyday research activities, there is not much theory to explain how and why the Internet improves R&D efficiency. This paper attempts to fill this void by exploring the association between the Internet and R&D efficiency. Initially, in order to provide a better unit of analysis, it adopts a feature-based approach to the Internet. Then it offers a conceptual framework which by using theoretical explanations, past empirical research and examples from practice explains how and why two features of the Internet ('search' and 'communication') improve three critical dimensions of R&D efficiency (cost, time and quality) and a firm's absorptive capacity. Finally, by using the Cobb-Douglas framework, it provides econometric evidence which indicates that the Internet does improve R&D efficiency. Besides the contribution to scholarly knowledge, there are important implications in practice, since the findings of this paper inform decision and policy makers that the Internet has a significant impact on firms' innovative capacity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on a recent nationwide survey covering 2334 Chinese industrial firms. The impact of technology transfer on their innovative performance was analyzed for all the responded firms and similar analyses also addressed the issue from perspectives of general industrial firms versus high-tech firms, and large firms versus small and medium firms. Several critical types of technology transfer activities were identified and both positive and negative impacts were discussed along with the Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis. The study revealed that the innovation activities in Chinese manufacturing firms could not be boosted substantially merely through the acquisition of key equipment and apparatus from abroad. The findings also suggested that Chinese firms should develop their technological absorptive capacity and transformative capacity, and foster technology transfer and communications among trading partners. Moreover, it would be crucial for Chinese firms to stress the nurturing of indigenous innovation capabilities so as to sustain their performance improvement. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Our study suggests that the type of external knowledge sourced determines the likelihood of creation of breakthrough innovation. We characterize the external knowledge utilized on two dimensions: its technological space and geographic origin. We draw on the concepts of local search and national innovation systems to identify critical knowledge inputs. We hypothesize that external knowledge characterized by technological distance or proximity and the national or international context can have a differential impact on breakthrough innovation. This is due to the contradictory implications of its value created by distance and to absorptive capacity limitations in effectively utilizing knowledge from a different context. To test our hypotheses we use patent data from the U.S. biotechnology industry. Our findings suggest that technologically distant knowledge of national origin has a curvilinear effect and technologically proximate knowledge of international origin has a positive effect on break-through innovation. However, simultaneous exploration along technologically and geographic dimensions is not useful to generating breakthrough innovation; technologically distant knowledge of international origin does not have a significant impact.

Codifying tacit know-how helps, but codification becomes more challenging as the know-how changes more frequently. Transfer of tacit know-how becomes much more complicated when it changes often. We need more research in this area, particularly to help production and operations managers who must ultimately use the new know-how and change their companies' production processes. The paper suggests a framework as a step in that direction. The framework focuses on the interplay between the level of codification and the rate of change of production know-how, and identifies four zones for classifying production know-how: ""slow and codified,"" ""slow and tacit,"" ""fast and codified,"" and ""fast and tacit."" Examples from McDonald's, Club Med, Intel, and AOL are used to illustrate primary transfer mechanisms for each zone (manuals and systems, people, joint-development, and projects, respectively). Appropriate absorptive capacities in the production units for each zone are also identified. Since the ultimate responsibility of operations managers is to improve (i.e., change) their production know-how as fast as possible, they would be wise to adopt policies that are closer to those suited for the ""fast and codified"" zone.

Coevolutionary theory encompasses both macrocoevolution with the external (local) environment and microcoevolution within the internal environment, i.e. among the MNC's parts (subsidiaries) and the whole, and the relations between the two. In making our argument, we distinguish the coevolutionary process (what happens) from coevolutionary capabilities (what is manageable and how), and then resort to the specific motors of causal ambiguity and absorptive capacity to link the two together. In this context, we argue more specifically that coevolution at different levels tends to occur at different speeds. The speed differential creates what we term a dis-synchronization effect in the coevolution of the MNC, which potentially impacts firm performance. In making our argument, we also show how a coevolutionary lens sheds novel light on the functioning of the MNC as an internal knowledge sub-economy and the advantage of hierarchies over markets in this regard. Constructively managing the tension between the macro and micro aspects of coevolution due to respective differences in coevolutionary pressures has direct implications for competitive advantage and is a critical challenge faced by managers. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It argues that faculty support for the objectives of university-industry relations (UIR) does not vary across disciplines and does not respond to university encouragement in a region with low absorptive capacity. These results are in contrast with those obtained in studies of technology leading countries like the USA. Furthermore, incentives for UIR may generate unpredicted dynamics while instruments to cooperate are not significant. Finally, support for the objectives of UIR should not be confused with the degree of R&D cooperation. The former is sensitive to university age while the latter is sensitive to gender, discipline, commitment to R&D and university encouragement.

Technology transfer issues and absorptive capacity arguments are examined to analyze the different technological capabilities of leading and lagging firms. In addition, a new strategic rationale (in terms of non-dominant market share firms) that has not been considered in prior studies analyzing knowledge-seeking FDI is offered. From a panel dataset which includes information on all foreign R&D investments made by publicly traded Japanese manufacturing firms (from 1974 to 1994), I show that Japanese firms investing in foreign R&D tend to be the non-dominant market share firms, but also the technologically leading firms across fairly diverse industries. By considering both the technological and market share positions of firms, this study reveals important characteristics that influence when firms use foreign R&D as part of a strategy to augment their technological capabilities.

Viewing knowledge as a strategic corporate resource, managers need to examine their own organizations to assess the degree of stored knowledge and absorptive capacity necessary to accomplish what is required for sustainable competitive advantage. A key question is whether or not the organizational structure is appropriate - from the perspective of both breadth and depth of knowledge - to the mission at hand. Breadth is obtained through employee diversity and connectedness depth through R&D experience as well as basic research initiatives, partnerships, joint ventures, etc. Overall, knowledge, like other strategic corporate resources, must be actively managed if it is to result in sustainable competitive advantage. © 2006 Industrial Research Institute, Inc."

It finds that on average middleincome countries use technologies at about one-half the rate of intensity of highincome countries and that the pace of technological progress in these countries has been much faster over the past 15 years. However, the level of technology achieved and the pace of progress vary widely across countries with the most advanced middle-income countries about as advanced as the less advanced high-income countries. Increased access to foreign technologies, through foreign direct investment, imports of high-technology products and intermediate inputs have played a central role in the dissemination of technologies from high-income countries to developing countries. However, such flows are not in themselves sufficient. A country's technological absorptive capacity (the level of basic and advanced technological literacy, the quality of the regulatory environment, access to finance, and the effectiveness of proactive government policies to promote technology creation and diffusion) determines the extent to which these technologies are absorbed by domestic firms and incorporated into daily economic life. Weak absorptive capacity in Latin America suggests that it is converging towards a lower level of technological achievement than countries in Europe and Central Asia. © OECD and The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, 2009."

The findings show that at the surface level the world of strategic leadership is likely to be transient and contingent, but at the deeper level it seems to be based on much more stable elements. A correct combination of absorptive and adaptive capacities merged with managerial wisdom provided the basis for effective strategic leadership at the beginning of the 20th century in a similar way as today. Indeed, the more things change, the more crucial is the combination of these basic elements matching with the organizational environment.

In response to studies that underscore the importance of maintaining strong and learning relationship between the organization and customer, many have turned to customer relationship management (CRM) to manage their interactions with their customers and other external entities. Although IT enables CRM, other organizational factors, such as organizational absorptive capacity's effect on innovativeness, may have greater impact on its ability to continually satisfy the business' customer needs and expectations. However, IT may be a critical element to both absorptive capacity and innovation. This study examines the relationship between IT diffusion, organizational absorptive capacity and innovation, and proposes a research model. A clearer understanding of these relationships will provide businesses a means to appropriately direct their investments in IT and absorptive capacity."

The results of an inductive study reveal two key arguments. First, we find that the process is an ""involved"" top-down approach, rather than middle-up-down or bottom-up, discussed in previous studies on new product creation. Top managers actively participate throughout the process, taking on four roles: evaluation of product market performance, selection of products for improvement, initiation of the innovation process through delegation to middle managers of the responsibility to organize bottom-level employees to take actions toward product improvement, and monitoring of progress to ensure improvement (ESIM). Top managers become involved as necessary to reduce the resistance of people at the middle and lower levels to change in current routines. Second, we find that in companies that achieve superior product improvement, managers have well-developed professional absorptive capacity and have routinized frequent interactions to evaluate, select, initiate, and monitor. Other characteristics of managers, such as personal absorptive capacity, incentive system, or mandate from above, are common across both high and low performers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the implicit assumption that speed has a linear relationship with project success lacks examination. Several perspectives including time compression diseconomies resulting from the limits of the capacity for human information processing, bounded rationality of decision making, ""absorptive capability"" of organizations, and organizational learning, are applied to the study of new product development (NPD) teams. We argue that uncertainty is a critical contingency for understanding speed in NPD. We propose that whether speed has a linear or curvilinear relationship with success will depend upon the degree of uncertainty. Our results show that the relationship is curvilinear when either technology uncertainty or market turbulence is high but linear when such uncertainty is low. In contrast, we find a curvilinear relationship under conditions of low market newness but not under conditions of high market newness. An important implication is that it is necessary to analyze the source and degree of uncertainty of a project before a time-based strategy is selected. The limitations and future research related to these results are discussed."

Design/methodology/approach - Used open-ended exploratory field interviews with 51 host country human resource and middle managers in 49 different MNC foreign subsidiaries with headquarters in six different countries. Learning needs in three major employee levels of operative, supervisory/middle management, and upper management were examined. Notes from the interviews were recorded by hand and combined and analyzed for evidence of potentially beneficial forms of HCN learning using procedures of domain and theme analysis in taxonomy development. Findings - A total of 12 categories of potentially beneficial forms of HCN learning were identified and discussed relative to their contributions to increased absorptive capacity. These forms of learning included such areas as new employee orientation and entry job skills, MNC predominant language, MNC home country cross-cultural awareness, supervision and technical operations management skills, expatriate coaching and liaison skills, and MNC strategy and culture. Research limitations/implications - Provides helpful insights on absorptive capacity to promote further theory development, as well as practical guidance for future HCN training to enhance the effective transfer of management knowledge and practice.

The advantages of regenerated cellulosic fibers are their exceptional purity, superior absorbency and their softness and opacity when used in absorbent nonwoven products. The main characteristics of the cellulosic fibers are water retention and water holding capacity. The water retention of a cellulosic fiber can be enhanced by the incorporation of hydrophilic polymers. The water holding capacity can be influenced by the modification of fiber titer, cross-section, crimp or finish. The incorporation of hydrophilic polymers such as starch, gaur gum, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), or alginate can also increase the high absorptive capacity of man-made cellulosic fibers. The absorption capacity of nonwovens can also be improved by increasing the capillary action, by controlling the size and shape of cavities formed within the fabric."

These relationships are investigated in a total of 406 Spanish manufacturing companies with an established degree of innovative activity. In addition the nature of the variable 'absorptive capacity' is considered and an index is suggested that would render this concept operational through analysis of the factors defining it and by which the process of building it up is influenced. As a result of this study it is demonstrated that the absorptive capacity variable determines innovative effort to a greater extent than the two structural variables. It is also shown that absorptive capacity has a moderating effect on the relationship between technological opportunity and innovative effort being this one of the most remarkable results obtained from the work. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that firms invest more in new ventures - commonly referred to as 'corporate venture capital' - in industries with weak intellectual property protection and, to some extent, in industries with high technological ferment and where complementary distribution capability is important. Furthermore, we find that the greater a firm's cash flow and absorptive capacity, the more likely it is to invest. Our results suggest that in Schumpeterian environments incumbents may supplement their innovative efforts by tapping into the knowledge generated by new ventures.

We also differentiate between absolute and relative components of absorptive capacity. Our study of the chemical-pharmaceutical industry found that technology learning was higher when firms were quick to adopt new technologies and when they have accumulated experience via alliances. Among alliances, cross-border R&D alliances have the strongest effect on technology learning. Overall, the findings show the pronounced effect of absolute absorptive capacity on technology learning. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We find that a firm's innovative capabilities and its network structure both enhance firm performance, while the innovativeness of its contacts does not do so directly. Innovative firms that also bridge structural holes get a further performance boost, suggesting that firms need to develop network-enabled capabilities - capabilities accruing to innovative firms that bridge structural holes.

The theoretical model identifies an underlying latent construct; knowledge embeddedness and its antecedents: Complementarity, compatibility, tacitness, trust, protectiveness, and coordination, which needs to be explicitly recognized and integrated in the theory of creation of synergies in SAs. While the individual importance of most of these variables has long been recognized in both SA and social exchange literature, their simultaneous effects have thus far been ignored. Embeddedness is hypothesized to be a full mediator of these effects on creation of synergies. Furthermore, absorptive capacity, network capacity, and collaborative know-how are proposed to moderate these effects. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Alliances and networks. Strategic Management Journal 19, 293-317], has resulted in little attention being given to transaction costs and knowledge-based imperatives for alliance formation. In addition, Contractor and Ra (2002) [Contractor, F.J., Ra, W., 2002. How knowledge attributes influence alliance governance choices: a theory development note. Journal of International Management 8, 11-27] illustrated that theory on governance modal choice from the perspective of transactions costs and knowledge characteristics is underdeveloped, thereby proposing an interactive model predicting governance modal choice in an attempt to redress this imbalance. Using a multiple case study methodology the present study examines the important aspects of governance mode and knowledge exchange in strategic alliances between a multi-national corporation (MNC) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In doing so this paper qualifies the model proposed by Contractor and Ra (2002) [Contractor, F.J., Ra, W., 2002. How knowledge attributes influence alliance governance choices: a theory development note. Journal of International Management 8, 11-27], suggesting a model framing knowledge value as the primary predictor of governance modal choice as an appropriate framework to evaluate both the knowledge exchange relationships and governance modal choice relationships between MNCs and SMEs. Thus this paper advances theory on the motives for alliances, specifically, the effect on governance modal choice of a company's desire to acquire or access knowledge. In addition the paper furthers theory on organisational learning and absorptive capacity focusing on their influence on governance mode, in the context of management strategy. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"Knowledge-processing capabilities and innovative performance: An empirical study","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23444456491&doi=10.1108%2f14601060510610199&partnerID=40&md5=15a22c4979c8dc8ad7a55923749bf513","Purpose - Knowledge-based assets and organizational learning capabilities are recognized to be critical for firm's innovation activities. The process of creating new knowledge requires acquiring useful data and information, and utilizing it effectively in its internal innovation activities. To manage external knowledge, firms need absorptive capacity. The purpose of this study is to present the concept of the firm's absorptive capacity as a multidimensional, dynamic construct consisting of capabilities for organizational knowledge processing. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on results from a large-scale survey. The empirical data used in the study comprises of 217 Finnish firms from seven different industry sectors. The hypotheses were tested by means of hierarchical linear regression analysis. Findings - The results of the empirical tests give some support to the view that it is not only the firm's knowledge stock but also its knowledge flows that are crucial for sustaining innovative performance. The regression estimation shows that knowledge-utilization capabilities were reflected in the firm's innovative performance. Research limitations/implications - As the data used in the study was cross-sectional, the causal relationships and the sustainability of innovative performance cannot be captured. Avenues for further research include the interaction between the firm's knowledge base, knowledge processes and innovativeness. Practical implications - This study emphasizes the importance of the firm's ability to utilize and renew its knowledge base effectively. In order to utilize externally generated knowledge, firms need an ability to internalize it and then combine the information and new insights with the existing knowledge base. Originality/value - As only little empirical research has been conducted on the impact of knowledge-processing capabilities on the firm's innovative performance, the empirical evidence reported here makes a valuable contribution in this highly important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The focus of this special issue is on better understanding rigidity and flexibility in business markets. This lead article seeks to elaborate on why companies face rigidity and how they can create flexibility. To do this, we relate rigidity in organizations to the concepts of dominant logic, industry recipe and persistence. The case illustrations highlight barriers to the development of absorptive capacity in business organizations. Identifying such barriers is a first step in better understanding how companies can remain agile and flexible in demanding and fast changing markets.

Specifically, by utilizing a formal model of firm R&D that shows that profit-maximizing firm R&D intensity is determined jointly by firm-specific technological competence and consumer preference regarding quality and price, this paper suggests that firm size affects firm R&D intensity not directly, but through its influence on firm-specific technological competence. In particular, four predictions are drawn and tested empirically: (1) in general, the size-R&D relationship is less-than-proportional or inverted U-shaped, especially for low-technological-competence firms; (2) however, the common less-than-proportional relationship disappears, and a more-than-proportional relationship becomes increasingly likely, for firms with high levels of technological competence, plausibly due to competence-enhancing, learning economies of scale and/or scope in R&D; (3) firms with larger accumulated R&D experience are, ceteris paribus, less likely to exhibit the common less-than-proportional relationship; (4) among industries, a greater within-industry departure from the proportional size-R&D relationship is expected for industries with seemingly high, rapidly changing technological-opportunity conditions. These predictions, especially pertaining to the conditioning role of technological competence in the size-R&D relationship, are empirically supported by the unique data by the World Bank. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recognizing the crucial role of MNCs'knowledge management in NPD, the authors develop a conceptual framework to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of international knowledge acquisition at the cross-team level. The framework suggests that though it is important to acquire necessary knowledge resources for NPD, managers must nurture an NPD project team's realized absorptive capacity to transform the acquired knowledge resources into NPD capabilities, which in turn affect new product market performance. © Journal of International Marketing."

This is done from the perspective of the dominant social paradigm, and argues that the limited success of governmental transfer programs can be attributed to paradigm conflicts between the developer of technology and the recipient. The conclusion suggests that the effectiveness of government technology transfer programs can be improved if a dual approach is adopted. For transfers to lesser developed countries, the initial step should be to understand the differences in paradigms, and this should be followed by the development of appropriate technologies that enhance the development potential of the recipient in terms of the recipients' values and worldviews. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Existing but generally opposing views related to the selection-adaptation debates are united to consider the dialogic nature of both approaches. It is argued that a Darwinian approach, as opposed to a neo-Darwinian or Lamarckian approach, provides the means to scale the sides of a debate that has for too long divided scholars interested in firm and industry transformation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper addresses three specific issues to develop its Darwinian argument. First, the various works of Geoff Hodgson that have for many years advanced Darwin's evolutionary ideas are used to argue the nature and application of Darwinism in the socio-economic domain. Second, the nature of what constitutes the elements of firm-environment interaction is considered to establish basic areas of focus through which the process of firm transformation is more understandable. Finally, the construct absorptive capacity is likened to a mechanism of transmission through which the learning processes associated with the acquisition of favoured variations can be reconciled with the generic evolutionary processes of variation, selection, and retention. Findings - To understand the process of firm learning, the role of habits and routines must be outlined in specific detail. They cannot be assumed to perform interacting and replicating roles simultaneously. To do so undermines the fundamental qualities of an evolutionary theory. Originality/value - The preliminary framework advanced takes us beyond the Darwinian-Lamarckian debate and provides elements of focus from which a greater understanding of the process of firm/industry transformation is possible. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In order to acquire needed capabilities, high technology new ventures engage in venturing strategies such as acquisitions and joint ventures. The top management team is an important source of inherited knowledge for these ventures and therefore influences their absorptive capacity. We hypothesise that high technology new ventures' ability to learn through venturing activities is influenced by their top management teams' human capital. This study analyses the human capital characteristics of the top management teams of 340 high technology new ventures from the USA. It is found that human capital diversity of the top management teams moderates the relationship between venturing activities and innovation and financial performance in these ventures. In contrast, the level of human capital has no effect. The implications for management practice and future research are discussed. Copyright © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

It is argued that without sufficient skills, firms benefit less from innovation, because they do not have the requisite complementary capabilities or absorptive capacity. Results from a panel of manufacturing firms provide support for the hypotheses that high technical skills are complementary with R&D collaboration and product or process innovation. Human capital can thus be seen as an enabling factor in profitable innovation. Policy implications suggest that investments in skills help expand the group of firms in the economy that have the potential to innovate successfully. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We hypothesize that these programs are especially effective in weak intellectual property (IP) regimes and when the firm has sufficient absorptive capacity. We analyze a large panel of public firms over a 20-year period and find that increases in corporate venture capital investments are associated with subsequent increases in firm patenting. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we assess the effect of these knowledge flows on incubator firm-level differential performance. Based on the resource-based view of the firm and the absorptive capacity construct, we advance the overarching hypothesis that knowledge flows should enhance incubator firm performance. Drawing on longitudinal and fine-grained firm-level data of 79 technology ventures incubated between 1998 and 2003 at the Advanced Technology Development Center, a technology incubator sponsored by the Georgia Institute of Technology, we find some support for knowledge flows from universities to incubator firms.

By measuring the degree of whiteness, absorbency, loss of mass and damage of fibres treated by various processes, the adequacy of process for treating sanitary material was estimated. The properties of fibres treated by one-stage process with enzymes and peroxiacetic acid were compared. The process, which includes alkali sco uring and/or peroxide bleaching, gives higher degree of whiteness and better absorptive capacity than the process, which includes bioscouring and/or bleaching with PAA. However, scouring with enzymes and bleaching with peroxiacetic acid is performed at 50 to 60 °C and at pH between 7 and 8 and the damages of fibres are negligible, so this process is an interesting alternative for conventional treatment."

It aims to provide an empirical exploration of the use of codified sources of information for innovation at the firm and sectoral level. Despite considerable interest in David and Foray's (1995) work on the codification of knowledge and the changing nature of innovation due to the use of information and communication technologies, there are relatively few empirical studies that probe the role of codified sources of information in the innovation process. Our goal is to assess how important codified sources of information are for innovation among different firms and sectors. We find that use of codified sources of knowledge is highly concentrated in high technology sectors and among firms with existing absorptive capacity. The analysis shows that the use of other sources of information for innovation is a strong predictor of a firm's use of codified sources. The data used for the analysis is based on The Netherlands Community Innovation Survey (II) for the manufacturing sector and covers over 2001 firms in 11 industries. © Springer-Verlag 2005."

Based on survey data on German innovating firms, we state that informal cooperation is both, more prevalent and more important than formal cooperation. We only find weak empirical evidence for the relevance of incoming knowledge spillovers for formal as well as for informal cooperation. In contrast, a firm's ability to protect its proprietary innovations, i.e., to limit outgoing knowledge spillovers, has a positive effect on a firm's propensity to engage in formal and informal cooperation at the same time. It does not affect, however, the probability of cooperating informally alone. Large firms, firms that operate a R&D department and firms that are involved in costly R&D projects tend to cooperate formally. Moreover, continuous R&D, which may reflect firms' absorptive capacities, and the innovation dynamics at the industry level do have a positive impact on vertical cooperations in general. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities."

This paper reverses those perspectives. It examines the influence of individual firms' absorptive capacities on both the functioning of the intra-cluster knowledge system and its interconnection with extra-cluster knowledge. It applies social network analysis to identify different cognitive roles played by cluster firms and the overall structure of the knowledge system of a wine cluster in Chile. The results show that knowledge is not diffused evenly 'in the air', but flows within a core group of firms characterised by advanced absorptive capacities. Firms' different cognitive roles include some - as in the case of technological gatekeepers - that contribute actively to the acquisition, creation and diffusion of knowledge. Others remain cognitively isolated from the cluster, though in some cases strongly linked to extra-cluster knowledge. Possible implications for policy are noted. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Although firms conduct international R&D to tap into knowledge bases that reside in foreign countries, we argue that in order to benefit from international R&D investments firms must already possess research capabilities in underlying or complementary technologies. We examine the international R&D expansion activities, research capabilities, and patent output of 65 Japanese pharmaceutical firms from 1980 to 1991. We find that firms benefit from international R&D only when they possess existing research capabilities in the underlying technologies. In addition to refining our understanding of when international R&D enhances firm innovation, our results integrate asset-seeking and asset-based theories of foreign direct investment. Internationalizing R&D to tap into foreign knowledge bases is consistent with asset-seeking theories of foreign direct investment, while the contingent nature by which firms benefit from international R&D is consistent with asset-based theories of foreign direct investment and the notion of absorptive capacity.

The emphasis is placed on the role of the technological gap between domestic and foreign firms in identifying the importance of technology diffusion from the presence of multinationals. An augmented production function is employed to account for technological, financial and market structure effects. Based on a sample of 2589 manufacturing firms operating in Greece between 1992 and 1997, the analysis provides evidence that the significance of spillovers varies with the relative technological position of domestic firms and is higher in the middle and upper quantiles of the growth distribution. It was estimated that a unit increase in the foreign presence in Greek industry raises output growth by 7% on average, in a five-year period, after controlling for technological differences among firms. This result is consistent with the 'absorptive capacity' hypothesis that the technological capability of the host country relates positively to FDI spillover benefits."

Absorptive capacity is the organization's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends [Cohen, W. M., & Levinthal, D. A. (1990). Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation. Administrative Science Quarterly, 35(March), 128-152]. Based on previous research, this study proposes a measure of absorptive capacity that includes managerial IT knowledge and communication channels and tests its relationship to the application of new technology in the form of expert systems implementation. Related to claims about the importance of absorptive capacity are claims that a ""learning culture"" or ""knowledge-friendly culture"" is necessary in order for knowledge to be gained and effectively used within the organization. This study examines the type of corporate culture that influences absorptive capacity. The results provide support for absorptive s proposed dimensions and its antecedent of corporate culture that act to influence the implementation of new technologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring PACAP as the breadth of a firm’s scientific activities and RACAP as its ability to identify and abandon poor performing areas of science, we test our theory using a sample of US and non-US firms in the chemical, electronics, and pharmaceutical industries.

However, Chinese high-tech firms in general lack knowledge. So, it is important for them to transfer knowledge from all kinds of sources. Given their initial stage of growth, low absorptive capacities, and incomprehensive institutional support, how can Chinese high-tech firms succeed? This paper explores the powerful effects of Chinese entrepreneur’s social capital, dimensioned as shared vision, social interaction ties, and trustworthiness, on the success of knowledge transfer by the mediating roles of guanxi development and absorptive capacity, which is very characteristic of the current status of Chinese high-tech firms. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Results indicate that organizational mechanisms associated with coordination capabilities (cross-functional interfaces, participation in decision making, and job rotation) primarily enhance a unit's potential absorptive capacity. Organizational mechanisms associated with socialization capabilities (connectedness and socialization tactics) primarily increase a unit's realized absorptive capacity. Our findings reveal why units may have difficulty managing levels of potential and realized absorptive capacity and vary in their ability to create value from their absorptive capacity."

Our empirical research also revealed four determinants that are shaping the overall degree of efficiency of the organisational frameworks. While the first two are proxies for the well-known concept of absorptive capacity, the last two describe what we term as multiplicative capacity.

We develop the idea that team creativity results primarily from integration of individually held expertise of team members at the team level. We further propose the quality of intrateam relationships and knowledge complementarities that align the work of individual team members at the project level influence creativity primarily through the process of expertise integration. We use data from a field study of 142 participants in 42 ISD projects to test the proposed model. The paper makes three new contributions to the IS literature. Its key contribution lies in developing an expertise integration view of team creativity. We demonstrate the centrality of integrating individually held tacit and explicit knowledge about the problem domain and the technology at the team level in achieving team creativity. The use of a process-focused conceptualization of team creativity is especially noteworthy here. The second contribution of the paper lies in conceptually developing and operationalizing the concept of expertise integration, a mechanism by which individually held knowledge is integratively applied at the project level. Although the importance of knowledge in the ISD process is widely recognized in prior research, this is the first study to develop the concept in a operationally meaningful way. The third key contribution lies in showing that the compositional and relational attributes of ISD project teams - diverse specialized knowledge in a team, the quality of intrateam working relationships, and members' cross-domain absorptive capacity - do not engender creativity by themselves; they do so primarily because they enhance integration of individual at the project level. We offer empirical evidence for such full mediation. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the paper. © 2005 M.E. Sharpe, Inc."

Design/methodology/approach - It is suggested that the employment of human resource practices, which affect absorptive capacity of knowledge receivers and support organizational learning environment, is positively related to the degree of knowledge transfer to the subsidiary. Moreover, the higher degree of knowledge transfer is expected when HRM practices are applied as an integrated system of interdependent practices. Hypotheses derived from these arguments are tested on the data from 92 subsidiaries of Danish multinational corporations (MNCs) located in 11 countries. Findings - Results of the analysis indicated the existence of two groups of HRM practices conducive to knowledge transfer. The simultaneous effect of the first group of HRM practices consisting of ""staffing"", ""training"", ""promotion"", ""compensation"" and ""appraisal"" on the degree of knowledge transfer was found to be positive and substantial. The hypothesis regarding the effect of corporate socialization mechanisms and flexible working practices (the second group of HRM practices) was not supported by the data. The analysis also indicated that some HRM practices have a complementary effect on the degree of knowledge transfer when they are applied as a system. Research limitations/implications - While this study makes a contribution to our understanding of the relationship between HRM practices and knowledge transfer in the MNC, clearly, additional research is needed to develop this link further, which until now has been largely black-boxed. Originality/value - Makes a contribution to our understanding of the relationship of HRM practices and knowledge transfer in MNCs."

Well-known both in research and business practice, employing benchmarking as a means of increasing the competitiveness goes along with considerable problems and challenges. By analyzing the very nature of benchmarking, it turns out that the respective problems can be explained in a comprehensive way by referring to the competence-based view. The paper points out the numerous threats connected with benchmarking. The isolating mechanisms, well-known from competence-based research, help to explain why it can be so difficult for firms to make use of benchmarking effectively. Among others, the concept of the absorptive capacity plays a major role when the real character of benchmarking is to be described. Understanding benchmarking as way to get access to firm-addressable resources, the recognition, the assimilation, and the exploitation of the benchmarked ""best practices"" represent the crucial steps of an effective benchmarking process. Pointing out the implications of benchmarking by a competence-based analysis and to draw some managerial and theoretical conclusions represent the main objectives of this paper. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Our research question reads as follows: To what extent does the strength of innovator firms' internal knowledge resources, the complexity of their innovative activities, and the structuring of their innovative activities influence the probabilities of interactive learning between innovating firms and actors in the knowledge infrastructure? We contend basically that more complex innovative activities increase the probability of internal resource deficits/shortages in innovating firms. The higher the resource deficits/shortages and the lower the alignment of innovative activities, the more likely the search for complementary resources externally, which induces higher probabilities of interactive learning with actors in the knowledge infrastructure. In order to test the generality of our theoretical claims six models were examined, predicting the probability of interactive learning of innovating firms with the knowledge infrastructure (universities and research centres) controlling for sectoral differences in technological dynamics and size effects. Both monotonic and non-monotonic effects were tested. Our findings show that antecedents of patterns of interactive learning differ widely and are contingent upon sectoral technological dynamics and firm size. Our findings enhance a substantial refinement of the main theoretical arguments explaining the level of interactive learning. The absorptive capacity effect turns out to have an inverted U-shape only for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The complexity effect is monotonic in some cases and non-monotonic in others. The interaction effect turned out to be U-shaped. The internal integration of innovative activities has no effect at all. Support by bridging institutions had a very strong influence on levels of interactive learning between innovating firms and knowledge infrastructure, but only for SMEs. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd."

The wider Europe is structured into three groups of countries, and CEECs fall into two, the less-developed and medium-developed EU groups. NICs in the enlarged EU are assessed across four dimensions of capacity: absorptive, R&D, diffusion and demand. In each of these dimensions a two- to three-tiering of countries is observed, which goes beyond a simple east-west pattern. The results of this assessment have important implications for new Member States and candidate countries, as well as for the EU policy towards structural assistance."

Rather, firms seeking extra-regional markets augment their in-house resources by means of material (embodied technology) and knowledge inputs obtained from sources at the extra-regional scale in addition to within the region. Literature is reviewed on the clustering of firms and their network geography, models of open and closed industrial systems, and absorptive capacity. The latter is used to interpret the search for knowledge undertaken by firms, which are discussed in terms of their organizational differences and strategic choices. A sample of manufacturing establishments from the electronics cluster in the Toronto metropolitan region (Canada) shows firms that are export-intensive have significantly stronger international input connections, especially with consultants and alliance partners. Export orientation is associated with higher levels of expenditure on the in-house generation of knowledge, more innovation inputs from external sources, and distinctive network geographies. Differences in network relations occur within and between three organizational groups of firms - foreign affiliates, multi-location and single-location domestic firms. Geographically wide-ranging networks are interpreted in terms of opportunities in extra-regional locations compared with local supplies.

The rationale behind this hypothesis is the theory of socially embedded ties that allow entrepreneurs to get resources cheaper than they could be obtained on markets and to secure resources that would not be available on markets at all, e.g. reputation, customer contacts, etc. This paper clarifies how entrepreneurial network activities can be measured and which indicators exist to quantify start-up success. It then reviews empirical studies on the network success hypothesis. The studies have rarely come up with significant results. This surprising evidence can be explained by large differences in the way that the dependent and the independent variables were defined and by effects of unobserved variables such as the networking expertise of the founders and the entrepreneurs' level of existing know-how in the areas of co-operation and networking ('absorptive capacity'). The major shortcomings of existing network studies are found to be the neglect of different starting conditions, the focus on individual founders' networks instead of multiple networks in start-ups with an entrepreneurial team, and the assumption of a linear causal relation between networking and start-up success. Accordingly, the paper develops a new, extended model for the relation between entrepreneurial networks and start-up success. Finally, we make some suggestions for the further development of entrepreneurial network theory. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd."

Sunlight reaches the Earth at wavelengths between 280 and 3000 nm. UV radiation ranges between 280 and 400 mn and is divided into three ranges of wavelengtbs: UVA (from 315 to 400 nm), UVB (from 280 to 315 nm) and UVC (from 100 to 280 nm). Especially the first two types give much concern because UVA radiation causes premature skin ageing, photodermatoses and phototoxic reactions and UVB radiation causes eritheme and sunburns, increases danger of malign melanoma and damages of eyes. Very high doses of sunburns caused by UVB even lead to the damage of DNA. UVC rays do not reach the Earth's surface because they are absorbed by ozone and air layers and do not represent any serious danger. However, thinning of ozone layer and increased ultraviolet radiation, which reaches the Earth cannot be considered the only factor responsible for increase of skin diseases. The contribution of changed life style and a fashion of tanned skin are significant as well. People are getting more and more aware that they should protect themselves adequately against negative effects of ultraviolet radiation and shorten the time of exposure to the sun. Protection of the skin, which is undoubtedly most important, has been limited to the application of sun protective creams on exposed parts of the body only. Fabrics were supposed to give enough protection to other parts of the body. However, that has proved to be untrue. The paper investigates the influence of the thickness of fibres, density of weaving and open surfaces on the UV protective efficiency of fabrics. For this purpose ten mesh fabrics woven from polyester monofilament yarns were analysed. Beside basic constructional parameters the influence of dyeing and layers (white and yellow) as well as the position of a dyed layer in combination with two not dyed layers was analysed. The measurements were carried out on a spectrophotometer with integrating sphere in conformity with the AATCC standard. Transmission of samples was measured and the values of ultraviolet protective factor calculated (UZF . It has been found that there is good correlation with open surface and that with a multilayer protection with combination of dyed and not dyed layers the position of a dyed layer is important. It has also been found that with increasing number of layers transmission is decreasing and UV protection improving. The research results show that the protective efficiency could be increased with suitable combination of reflective and absorptive layers, i.e. with combination of white reflective layers and dyed absorptive layers."

Using the number of products and processes at all stages of development as an indicator of creative capacity, results show that absorptive capacity, relational capital, learning, expansion into international markets, and firm characteristics are all key determinants of creative capacity. However, not all these factors are equally important at all stages of product development. For example, results show that at the R&D stage, success drivers are firm absorptive capacity and firm characteristics. But issues related to product commercialisation have no bearing on creative capacity at that stage. Expansion into international markets and experience in biotechnology are the greatest firm creative capacity assets at the Production/Commercialisation stage."

The networks - personal or business - with which these firms interact the most are usually geographically or sociologically close by, embedded in the environment, and are known as strong tie networks. They generally supply signals in a familiar language, based on habit as well a good reciprocal knowledge, which are easy to understand. In addition to this, however, the most dynamic firms also have contacts with weak tie networks, which are further removed from the usual behaviours of entrepreneurs and provide weak signals that, while difficult to grasp and decode, nevertheless offer new, pre-competitive information that can support major innovations. Very little empirical research has been done so far to test the probability of this theory. This paper reports on the results of a survey involving 147 SMEs, all in the land-based transportation equipment sector. It confirms the importance of weak tie networks as opposed to other types of networks, recognizing their complementary contribution to technological innovation. The organization's absorptive capacity is also found to be a significant intermediary factor in taking advantage of weak tie networks. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd."

"R&D co-operation and innovation a microeconometric study on French firms","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842580243&doi=10.1016%2fj.respol.2003.09.010&partnerID=40&md5=9b4c5eda04ae650c4820199e26cc78e1","The scope of this paper is to report new empirical evidence on the determinants of R&D co-operation. Indeed, the literature on the capabilities of firms emphasises the role of knowledge in the performance and evolution of firms who use knowledge developed in others to build their own knowledge capital. R&D co-operation between firms is one of the many strategies by which this knowledge may be transmitted. Several theoretical models have stressed that R&D co-operation is more likely when the level of spillovers is high. While this supposition is used in many theoretical models, it has rarely been tested before. Our results do not lend strong support to this intuition. Indeed, our spillover variables (national pure spillovers, national rent spillovers and imports of machine tools), which were supposed to match the theoretical notion of spillovers used in these theoretical models have a positive but not a significant role when explaining R&D co-operation. The R&D co-operation increases with size and with R&D intensity, but not with market share. It also increases with the budget spent on paying license fees and on acquiring patents and labour from foreign firms. In this study, we also analyse the determinants of innovation. In more precise terms, we compare the effects of R&D co-operation to those played by traditional internal factors and those exerted by external, pure and rent spillovers on the innovation capacity of the firms. Our results show that the commercial success of innovations of French firms depends mainly on size, market share, R&D intensity and human capital. Inward FDI from industrialised countries exerts a positive and significant effect. The finding highlights the important role of the absorptive capacity of firms. Spillover measurements, such as the acquisition of machine tools, foreign patents, licenses, and technological opportunities have a positive impact on innovation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is closely tied to both basic and applied research, innovation in the semiconductor industry depends mainly upon applied research. Surprisingly, many firms perform little basic research, but they produce many innovations. Within each industry, firms pursue different R&D strategies: firms that emphasize basic research absorb more basic scientific knowledge than those that emphasize applied research. These findings suggest that future research must carefully consider how industry context and the composition of R&D mediate the relationship between research and innovation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers have investigated how managers may develop absorptive capacity by building internal knowledge stocks, but few have focused on the distribution of this knowledge within the firm and the role managers play in administering information to organizational subunits. In this paper, we explore the degree to which managers can develop absorptive capacity by directly providing information to agents in the organization that might potentially adopt a new practice. We find that the effectiveness of managerial information provision depends on the degree to which potential adopters have information from other sources. We find that information from previous adopters and past events reduces the effect of information provision, while experience with related practices amplifies it. Our research helps clarify when absorptive capacity may provide a sustained competitive advantage. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

To gain a competitive advantage in these highly competitive markets, many business organizations have turned to customer relationship management (CRM), an integrated system that draws upon the strengths of IT, to allow them to gain greater insights into their customers' needs. This study examines the relationship of information technology (IT) intensity and organizational absorptive capacity to CRM practices and performance. Data collected through a survey of Taiwanese financial service companies generally suggest that CRM practices mediate the effects of IT intensity and organizational absorptive capacity on CRM performance. Thus, it behooves organizations that seek to compete in global markets to invest in developing both their IT infrastructure and organizational absorptive capacity, and apply these resources toward building their marketing intelligence and innovating products and services that meet their customers' needs and expectations."

At the organisational level, a knowledge advantage is widely considered a sustainable source of competitive advantage. However, managing knowledge requires a complex combination of new tools, infrastructures, processes, strategies, and their coexistence and integration with the existing ones. Whether at the top of a CEO’s agenda or considered a faddish practice, knowledge management (KM) is both compelling and overwhelming. This paper examines the implementation of KM from an absorptive capacity perspective. A case study is presented to illustrate how the framework can be used to assess the importance of an organisation’s familiarity with KM principles, techniques, and strategic value; and whether it has the required learning capabilities to successfully adopt and implement KM. © 2004 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

In this paper, our unit of analysis is a complex high technology product and the system of alliance linkages formed to progress a product through R&D milestones. We present a model and evidence for advancing our understanding of how achieving early-to-market returns depends on systemic absorptive capacity. This systemic absorptive capacity is the cumulative efficiency in the use of absorptive capacity to link changing lead innovators across successive milestones in R&D product development. We advance propositions of how systemic absorptive capacity can explain performance differences between rival product development systems competing for early-to-market returns with similar products through accelerating speed to market, cost and quality advantages. These explanations are contrasted with the conclusions of previous studies that have focused on absorptive capacity of single firms or single alliances in R&D."

Sci Q., 35 (1990) 128). There are however other efforts that enhance the ""original"" definition of absorptive capacity and these relate to the way firms interact with their environment. Empirical data from an extensive survey that was carried out in seven European countries, namely Greece, Italy, Denmark, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, provides evidence for studying the relative effectiveness of specific mechanisms of knowledge creation and knowledge transfer.

In this paper, we focus on one aspect of foreign market knowledge, which is the knowledge a partner in a dyadic relationship, has of the other partner and of their respective business network relationships. The concept 'absorptive capacity' [Admin. Sci. Q. 35 (1990) 128] is used to describe the firm's ability to use its prior related knowledge and diverse background to identify the value of new information and to develop this into something creative. We develop and empirically test a model of how depth and diversity of experience affect absorptive capacity, and how this absorptive capacity affects the way a lack of foreign market knowledge is perceived as an obstacle in carrying out the ongoing business activity.The results show that the lack of foreign market knowledge in the ongoing business is determined both by the firm's absorptive capacity generated in dyadic relationships with foreign customers and the customer's network. The dyadic and network absorptive capacities, however, appear to be used differently in the ongoing business. Dyadic absorptive capacity seems to decrease the lack of foreign market knowledge, whereas customer network absorptive capacity seems to increase it. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The descriptive results show that the health sector leads the way in biotechnology utilization, followed in decreasing order by the agriculture and food processing sector and the environment sector. Furthermore, biochemistry and immunology based biotechnologies are the most used, with 76% of the 282 firms surveyed firms using them, as compared to 74% for bioprocessing based biotechnologies, and 52.5% for DNA based biotechnologies. Analytical results from multivariate analyses show that biotechnology development is fairly more industry specific than firm specific. In fact, the extent to which a firm's absorptive capacity (AC), its learning capability, and its stock of relational capital affects its utilization of biotechnology depends largely on the industrial sector to which the firms belongs. Firm's characteristics, namely, age and size, are found to have no effect on the utilization of biotechnology. Crown Copyright © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Using survey and archival data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry during the period 1981-91, we find that different approaches to technology sourcing (internal R & D and external R & D) are related to different types of biotechnology-based output at the end of the period. Internal R & D was positively associated with patent output. Acquisition activity was positively related to number of biotechnology-based products. Greater use of R & D contracts and licenses was associated with stronger reputation for possessing expertise in biotechnology. These findings underscore the importance of taking a multifaceted approach to technology sourcing in order to build the absorptive capacity needed to generate new technical output. Surprisingly, we also found that involvement in joint ventures was negatively related to patent output. This raises interesting questions about the strategic use of joint ventures in a regime of encompassing technological change."

A seven-region, seven-traded-commodity version of a dynamic computable general equilibrium model is used to achieve this task. A 0.63% Hicks-neutral biotechnological progress in the source region (U.S.) has differential impacts on the productivity of the log-using sectors in the domestic as well as in the recipient regions. Since recipient regions' ability to utilize biotechnology innovations depends on their absorptive capacity (AC) and structural similarity (SS), we construct the AC and SS indices based on multiplicity of factors such as human capital endowments, skill content and social appropriateness of the new innovations. The model results show that biotechnological innovations in the U.S. forest sector result in a significant increase in timber production. Following the productivity improvements and its embodied spillover, wood products and pulp and paper sectors in the U.S. register higher productivity growth. The role of AC and SS in capturing technical change is shown to be evident. In the face of growing regulations on timber production from public forests, increasing productivity through biotechnology may be the most effective way to meet the consumer demand for forest products. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

To better understand DFI roles, we conducted multiple interviews with participants affiliated with DFIs, firms and TIs in India. From data gathered from these interviews and secondary data on DFIs in emerging economies, we develop a preliminary framework to suggest that DFIs, when proactive in making technology assessments, form an important link between developing a firm's absorptive capacity and building a nation's innovative capacity.

However, through contrasting the various learning process theories described in the research on organizational, group, and individual learning, we develop a set of competing hypotheses that suggest some degree of variation might improve the learning rate. Furthermore, such comparison yields competing arguments about how related or unrelated such task variation should be to improve the learning rate. This research uses an experimental study to answer the following research questions: Is the learning rate maximized through specialization? Or does variation, related or unrelated, enhance the learning process? We find that the learning rate under conditions of related variation is significantly greater than under conditions of specialization or unrelated variation, indicating the possibility of synergy between related learning efforts consistent with an implicit learning or insight effect. We find no significant differences in the rates of learning under the conditions of specialization and unrelated variation.

Absorptive capacity is operationalized by ‘systematic or continuous R&D’ and output innovation by ‘percentage of sales from new products’. Technological opportunities are divided into several industry and non-industry related variables. Our results show the positive effect that both the industry's technological opportunities and a systematic approach to R&D exert on output innovation. Moreover, firms with a systematic approach to R&D usually achieve higher innovation output than firms which do not follow this approach.

In contrast to existing theory, which has a tendency to address the role of cognitive factors such as tacitness, causal ambiguity and absorptive capacity, this paper suggests that motivation needs to be in place first. In the studied case, differences in local perceptions of transfer ventures, aspiration and strategic ambitions, internal competition, the view on the nature of knowledge and local communication seem to explain success and failure in transfer ventures. If motivation is not in place ‘naturally’, it can be managed in different ways, including local and corporate management control routines as well as organization structure. Consequently, we argue that knowledge transfer theory should not presume that organizational units are interested in the knowledge transferred, or that knowledge is always ‘good’.

We argue that these knowledge structures and their specific components lead to successful innovation. A firm's prior knowledge facilitates the absorption of new knowledge, thereby renewing a firm's systematic search, transfer and acquisition of knowledge and capabilities. In particular, the exponential growth in biotechnology is characterized by the convergence of disparate scientific and technological knowledge resources. This paper examines the shift from protein-based to DNA-based diagnostic technologies as an example, to quantify the value of a firm's prior knowledge using relative values of knowledge distance. The distance between core prior knowledge and the rate of transition from one knowledge system to another has been identified as a proxy for the value a firm's prior knowledge. The overall ‘difficulty of transition’ from one technology paradigm to another is discussed. We argue this transition is possible when the knowledge distance is minimal and the transition process has a correspondingly high value of absorptive capacities. Our findings show knowledge distance is a determinant of the feasibility, continuity and capture of scientific and technological knowledge. © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

We specifically focus on two major research questions: 1) How do different dimensions of absorptive capacity affect organizational responsiveness; 2) Does the influence of absorptive capacity on organizational responsiveness vary across high-performing firms and low-performing firms? These questions were examined using structural equation modelling in a sample of 242 SMEs. Our results suggest that the three dimensions of absorptive capability, acquisition, dissemination and assimilation were not mutually independent but interrelated, and also have positive influence on organizational responsiveness. Furthermore, we found that high-performing SMEs are much more effective in managing the interrelatedness of the three dimensions than low-performing SMEs, Implications and future research directions were provided."

Although the technology transfer encompasses great a many different types of activities, the transfer process can be examined according to six major elements, namely, the transfer item, the technology donor, the technology recipient, the transfer mechanism, the rate of diffusion of technology and the absorptive capacity of the recipient. These are several ways in which technology can be transferred from donor to recipient. Some of these mechanisms include turnkey operations, the technological enclave, licensing, joint ventures, patents, in house transfers to foreign subsidiaries, simple emulation of a product or a process, direct purchase of naked technology, embodied technology/technological services, education abroad, site-visits and on training, international co-operative research efforts, meetings and seminars. Scientists from the developing world are involved at various levels in the process of technology transfer. In the process of participating in all these activities the innovative process may come into play. Medical ""technology"" implies understanding of the equipment and paraphernalia of medicine and the art and skill in using it. The International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Kenya Trypanosomiasis Institute (KETRI) amongst others have notably participated in the development of Bio-Medical technology at various levels. Contributions of various African Scientists in the development of techniques and methods of treatment and control of various diseases is outstanding and has been of great assistance to drug companies for the development of products. The output of Research and Development must be considered productive and may lead to development of new technologies or improvement of existing ones. Industries are the beneficiaries here as they produce products that are sold to final users. The patenting of such products or know-how should reflect the participation of third world Scientists. High level of technological awareness must therefore be created among researchers and scientists of the third world. A system that protects intellectual property rights that works must be created. Joint cooperative research projects between the third world scientists and scientist of the developed world should lead to the beginning of a breakthrough in the technological underdevelopment of these countries towards the year 2000 and beyond. While conferences, intensive seminars and workshops are to be encouraged even more, work well done must not end up in shelves as papers presented in high scientific conferences."

In particular, we are interested in whether indigenous R&D activity is concentrated in the same regions and research areas as foreign R&D, which is necessary to facilitate successful knowledge spillovers between the two groups. While there is evidence that there are regional clusters of indigenous and foreign-owned firms, the data suggest that there is a low probability of successful knowledge spillovers from foreign to indigenous firms. This is because foreign-owned firms undertake R&D primarily in different regions and in different research areas than indigenous firms. This suggests two policy implications. First, the scale of indigenous R&D needs to be increased in order to improve indigenous absorptive capacity for spillovers. Second, the research areas of foreign and indigenous firms need to be highly correlated to optimise the potential for successful knowledge spillovers."

How can business performance of e-service companies be improved in today's knowledge-based economy? These research questions are the subject of this paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature, our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies, namely human capital, structural capital, and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options, than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably, with the advent of the Internet, different operating models (e.g., bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar, or pure dot-com) have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies. Thus, the new e-operations paradigm can be viewed as a configuration of knowledge-based competencies and capabilities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved."

Different types of corporate knowledge are placed on a spectrum between a classic public good and deeply embedded knowledge. Hypotheses are developed regarding knowledge characteristics such as transfer costs, consequences of appropriation, observability, information asymmetry between negotiating partners, the difficulty of valuing knowledge, and the ""disclosure dilemma."" Next, hypotheses are presented on the choice of alliance governance mode as determined by knowledge attributes (codification, newness, complexity, and teachability) and partner characteristics (such as knowledge absorptive capacity). These testable propositions should make for fruitful empirical studies on the relatively little researched area of alliance governance modal choice. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved."

Results reveal significant associations between technology absorptive capacity and the critical factors - technology diffusion channels, interaction mechanisms, and R&D resources. Organizational cultures impact on interaction mechanisms, R&D resources, absorptive capacity and transfer performance. Different organizations will experience different technology transfer performance. Focuses explicitly on technology absorptive capacity within the field of empirical technology transfer research.

Based on a study of 198 suppliers operating in the food packaging machinery industry, structural equation modelling has revealed that customers actually assign suppliers different roles and give them varying levels of responsibility in the product development and manufacturing stages. These roles are correlated to the supplier's distinctive innovation capabilities. Clustering analysis is used to divide the suppliers into homogeneous groups. Innovative capabilities are not only associated with traditional competencies in R&D and product/process innovation but also in supportive capabilities in the form of absorptive capacity, technological scanning, innovation-oriented culture, skills and know-how of individuals and managerial practices. The impact of different innovative capabilities (both technological and managerial) on critical performance factors such as price, quality, time and flexibility is measured for each type of supplier in turn. The research findings lend support to the hypothesis that the level of investment in technology and the acquisition of specific managerial capabilities are, to a large extent, a determinant of supplier-customer interdependence. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Considering international trade as the primary vehicle for transborder technology flows, it can be inferred that the higher is the trade share for a region, the higher are the technology flows. Many LDCs have pursued liberal trade and technology policies and have relied on technologies originating in the advanced, industrialised nations of the world for their growth. However, to be of use to the LDCs (i.e., the recipients), this technology must be captured by them. For this to occur they need to nurture absorptive capacity (AC) which depends on the human capital or skill content of their work force. 'AC' is defined as the recipient country's capacity to identify, procure and use the state-of-the-art diffused via the conduit of foreign trade in intermediates. Greater endowment of educated labour force facilities inflows of technology. This paper highlights the fact that a better-educated workforce is beneficial for effective assimilation of foreign improvement of technology. Because human capital intensity of the workforce helps to embody technological benefits, by presenting the set of stylised facts we highlight the role of 'AC' in acquisition of trade induced technology flows. However, we do not provide a formal theoretical framework here; rather we provide a review of stylised facts that serve as a backdrop for further theoretical exploration. Probing beyond the quantifiable causes and providing a structural account is beyond the scope of this paper. The stylised facts on TFP growth and growth in real GDP are presented in Section 2. After discussing the changes in the commodity composition of trade in Section 3, we present evidence on human capital and on skill intensity, on TFP and on growth in real GDP in Section 4.

First, trust between an IJV's parents and the IJV's relative absorptive capacity with its foreign parent are suggested to influence its ability to understand new knowledge held by foreign parents. Second, an IJV's learning structures and processes an proposed to influence its ability to assimilate new knowledge from those parents. Third, the IJV's strategy and training competence are suggested to shape its ability to apply the assimilated knowledge. Revisiting the Hungarian IJVs studied by Lyles and Salk (1996) 3 years later, we find support for the knowledge understanding and application predictions, and partial support for the knowledge assimilation prediction. Unexpectedly, our results suggest that trust and management support from foreign parents are associated with IJV performance but not learning. Our model and results offer a new perspective on IJV learning and performance as well as initial insights into how those relationships change over time. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd."

Major issues explored in this paper include how a firm in Taiwan establishes an OEM relationship with its world-class competitors, how the relationship was maintained, and how knowledge transfer was facilitated under such a relationship. Findings of our study suggest that the Taiwanese firms deliberately chose to collaborate with their world-class competitors in order to learn from them. Under OEM sub-contracting, knowledge transfer took place in a systematic fashion. The types of knowledge transferred were diverse, and the transferred knowledge influenced profoundly the firms' operations or even their ways of thinking. Such knowledge transfer enhanced the firms' absorptive capacity, and could be divided into several phases. Benign contexts in which mutual trust developed between the firms and their OEM buyers facilitated the transfer of knowledge. Propositions for further research are proposed."

There are many theoretical works devoted to the theme but few empirical studies have been carried out with large samples to analyze the factors which determine why firms cooperate in R&D. We first review the reasons offered by the literature to explain technological cooperation, with this allowing us to determine the conceptual framework and to propose some hypotheses. We test these hypotheses with a sample of 1652 Spanish firms that have carried out R&D activities. The results obtained suggest that firms' motivations for cooperative R&D are the complexity of technology and the fact that innovation is costly and uncertain. We find that in order to undertake cooperative R&D, it is necessary to have certain internal capacities in this area, with our results being supported by the theory of absorptive capacity. However, and by contrast with the results presented in other works, questions related to market access and search for opportunities do not appear to exert an influence over cooperative R&D. Besides, the large sized firms resort more to cooperation, and the reasons for cooperative R&D differ as between large and small sized firms. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."

Therefore, researchers have examined those characteristics of alliances that can contribute to the performance of high technology companies. There is agreement that the structure and knowledge flows within alliances can affect a firm's innovativeness. However, to date, researchers have studied alliances as individual events or transactions, failing to recognize their synergistic effects as a coherent portfolio. Viewing alliances as a portfolio of strategic agreements, we suggest that portfolio characteristics will be associated with a high technology firm's innovative and financial performance. Also, we suggest that portfolio characteristics will influence absorptive capacity. We test these propositions using a sample of 2456 alliances formed by 143 biopharmaceutical firms. The results indicate that alliance portfolio characteristics and absorptive capacity jointly influence performance.

A temporal model of technology diffusion is developed including external sources, channels of technology transfer, and mechanisms involved in the transfer of technology into the innovative small firm. The model is related not only to ‘best practice’ but also to cases in which ‘low’ activity can be improved.

In this paper, we examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and new product development performance. Absorptive capacity is defined as the ability to acquire external information, assimilate it, and exploit it for commercial ends (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). We would expect that greater absorptive capacity, which provides a greater capability to acquire and exploit external information, would lead to more effective new product development. In this paper, we test this proposition using data from the computer modem industry over a 24-year period. Absorptive capacity is operationalized by R&D intensity, and new product development performance is measured by the technical performance of new products. Our results indicate that the relationship between absorptive capacity and new product development performance is nonlinear.

In short, the strategic opportunities of subsidiaries seem to generate more attention in the literature than their results. The two distinctive features of this paper are the development of the concept of subsidiary performance and the exploration of the linkage between subsidiary business context and performance. More specifically, by drawing on the literature about organizational learning, absorptive capacity and embeddedness in business relationships, some hypotheses will be formulated about the causal link between subsidiary environment and subsidiary performance. These hypotheses are then tested in a LISREL model based on data concerning 98 subsidiaries belonging to Swedish MNCs.

The existence and uniqueness of a feedback-Nash-optimal R&D strategy for each firm are discussed. Our simulations highlight that variations in spillovers hardly influence the firms' R&D investment, if their absorptive capacities to exploit extramural knowledge depend on their R&D efforts. Moreover, extramural knowledge cannot completely replace in-house R&D. However, a high level of public R&D favors the firm with the most restrictive R&D expenditure constraint and/or with the lowest initial R&D stock, provided it invests in R&D."

Two types of sludge were utilized, and submitted to three types of treatment including drying, pirolysis, and chemical activation. The adsorption capacity of the different samples were evaluated using their corresponding iodine number. This number is a characteristic parameter for an adsorbent and the procedure for its determination is a standard test method. The iodine number for activated carbon was determined as a reference value from a commercially available adsorbent. Adsorption essays using phenol and methylene blue as adsorbates were also carried out. The results suggested that dried sewage sludges had great adsorptive capacity for iodine and methylene blue while those which had been chemically activated were the most efficient for phenol adsorption."
"Subsidiary embeddedness and competence development in MNCs - A multi-level analysis","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0040621639&doi=10.1177%2f0170840601226005&partnerID=40&md5=83bba244259fb687268b03e626533dae","Recent research on the competitive advantage of multinational corporations (MNC) has emphasized the importance of the ability of subsidiaries to assimilate new knowledge from their external environment. Such an ability is important for the individual subsidiary's own performance as well as for the possibility it affords the MNC to combine and use, resources from different parts of the corporate system. This paper explores the nature of business embeddedness at the subsidiary level and its role at the corporate level. It is suggested that the subsidiaries' embeddedness in a network of business actors can explain why certain subsidiaries demonstrate higher achievements than others, both in terms of their market performance and regarding their importance for competence development within the MNC. It is argued that the closer a subsidiary's external business relationships with suppliers and customers the easier it will be to assimilate new knowledge from outside, the more it will be able to innovate and therefore the more it will be able to advance its performance in the local market. Further, because embeddedness influences the innovative capacity of subsidiaries, it is also claimed to be a decisive factor in explaining which subsidiaries will contribute to competence development at the corporate level. Hypotheses concerning the relationships between a subsidiary's external technical embeddedness, market performance and the subsidiary's importance for competence development at the level of the MNC are formulated and tested in a LISREL model. Data is used from 97 subsidiaries belonging to 20 global divisions of 13 Swedish multinational corporations. The results indicate that a subsidiary's external technical embeddedness can be a strong predictor of both its own expected market performance and its role as a provider of competence to other MNC units. The paper concludes with a discussion about the role that a subsidiary can play as a bridgehead between external and internal units of an MNC and the negative impacts that might occur if a subsidiary's business network is too embedded."

Interactive learning is defined as the exchange and sharing of knowledge resources conducive to innovation between an innovator firm, its suppliers, and/or its customers. Our research question is: Why do levels of interactive learning of innovator firms, their customers, and/or suppliers vary? Our theoretical framework combines a resource-based perspective with an activity-based account of interactive learning. It starts with a resource-based argument, which is specified by introducing competing and complementary theoretical arguments such as the complexity and structuring of innovative activities, and sectoral technological dynamics. The strength of internal knowledge resources can either hamper or facilitate levels of interactive learning. We assume that more complex innovative activities urge firms to co-ordinate and exchange information between users and producers, which implies a higher level of interactive learning. The structuring of innovative activities, as well as sectoral technological dynamics can foster interactive learning. To test our theoretical claims, we estimated six models predicting the level of interactive learning of innovator firms with: (1) their customers (here the innovating firms are the producers); (2) their suppliers (here the innovating firms are the customers); (3) with customers and suppliers split by size (four separate models). These analyses allow a comparison of the antecedents of interactive learning of innovator firms performing dual roles, and having a different size. Both monotonic and non-monotonic effects of the complexity of innovative activities, the strength of the internal knowledge base, and monotonic effects of the structuring of innovative activities are tested. Our findings suggest that our theoretical model best fits the interactive learning of small-and medium-sized innovator firms. Interactive learning with customers is positively associated with the complexity and structuring of innovative activities, and with moderate scores of the cross-product term of 'complexity of innovative activities and the strength of knowledge resources'. Interactive learning with customers is positively affected by higher technological dynamics. Stronger internal knowledge resources yield positive effects on interactive learning with suppliers up to a threshold point. Once this threshold is crossed, the effects of stronger knowledge resources become negative. Interactive learning with suppliers as well as with customers is positively associated with internal and external structuring of innovative activities, but is not affected by sectoral technological dynamics."

While there is a clear indication in the literature of a greater reliance on external sources of technology, the factors driving this phenomenon and the potential benefit to firm performance have received limited empirical attention. This study addresses these issues by testing the relationships between several potential determinants of external technology sourcing, and the differential impacts of external vs. internal sourcing on firm performance. The study addresses three potential determinants of external technology sourcing: discontinuous technological change life cycle stage (the stage of the resulting life-cycle patterns developed around radical technological changes, or DTC-life cycle), intellectual property protection, and internally available resources. DTC-life cycles, and the industries built around them, are characterized by patterns of competitive behavior and a few key milestones, particularly the emergence of a dominant design. For example, the early stages of the life cycle are characterized by a focus on product technologies, as firms compete to develop the technical standard for the industry, while the later stages are more concerned with process technologies, as firms compete to produce the standard at the lowest cost. We argue that DTC-life-cycle analysis can inform the ""internal vs. external"" decision and that the evolution from a product-based competition to a cost-based competition will affect not only the focus of that external sourcing but also the benefits received as a result. Further, we suggest that perceived intellectual property protection and the level of resources available internally to the firm will also impact the decision to source technology externally. The growing interest in external technology acquisition would appear to reflect a positive effect on firm performance. The literature, however, is equivocal and often anecdotal, focusing only on a limited perspective of firm performance. We investigate the relationship between external technology acquisition (vs. internal technology development) and firm performance from three perspectives: product-, market-, and finance-based measures of performance. Further, given that the focus of external technology acquisition will be driven in part by life-cycle stage (earlier stages focus on product technology and later stages focus on process technology), we also study the effect that focus has on related firm performance measures; i.e., how will product-related external technology acquisition affect product-based performance measures and how will process-related external technology acquisition affect cost- (or finance) based measures. Finally, we investigate the impact of internal resource capability on the existing relationship between external technology acquisition and firm performance; i.e., the absorptive capacity argument. Data collected from 188 U.S. subsidiaries of both domestic (U.S.) and foreign firms were used to test hypothesized relationships among these variables: DTC-life cycles, intellectual property protection, internally available resources, external technology acquisition, and firm performance. While not all hypotheses were supported, the results on the relationship between external technology acquisition (vs. internal technology development) and the three firm performance perspectives warrant caution for technology managers considering or currently utilizing external sources of technology. The more salient results and implications for managers are presented below. First, regarding the potential drivers for external technology acquisition, the results varied with theoretical expectations. Contrary to theory, neither DTC-life cycle nor intellectual property protection exhibited a significant relationship to external sourcing, in general. However, consistent with expectations, the level of available internal resources did exhibit a direct and negative relationship to external acquisition. Firms with greater internal resources are less inclined to source externally. Second, technology managers would be well advised to consider a number of issues when approaching the decision to acquire technology externally or develop it internally. In all cases where a statistically significant relationship between external technology acquisition and firm performance was found, the direction was negative, indicating that acquiring technology externally detracts from firm performance. Further, in limited cases, that negative relationship is compounded in the presence of internal technology capabilities. Also, a significant relationship was found between external product technology acquisition and product performance measures (and not for financial performance measures), and between external process technology acquisition and finance performance measures (and not for product performance measures), as expected, and were both negative. In other words, the dimension of performance most hindered by external technology acquisition is precisely that dimension that managers might strategically target at a given stage in the technology life cycle. The availability of technical resources internal to the firm was in all cases positively associated with product, market and financial performance measures. These results taken together suggest that firm performance is negatively impacted by external technology acquisition, firms with internally available resources typically do not tend to seek external technology, and when they do, in some cases the negative relationship between external sourcing and performance is increased. Clearly, external technology acquisition is not a panacea and great care must be taken to ensure firm success - and our findings suggest that all else equal, firms may want to err on the side of internal development. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc."

The ability to choose an R&D approach is accommodated by positing a three-stage game in which the choice of an R&D approach is made in its first stage. The firms' R&D budgets and output levels are chosen in the game's second and third stages, respectively. It is found that when firms cooperate in the setting of their R&D budgets, i.e. form a research joint venture, they choose identical broad R&D approaches. On the other hand, if they do not form a research joint venture, then they choose firm-specific R&D approaches unless there is no danger of exogenous spillovers. The analysis suggests that the commonly employed representation of firms' effective R&D investment levels implicitly presupposes that the firms have chosen to cooperate in setting their R&D budgets. © Elsevier Science B.V."

The amount of absorptive capacity a fm has and its position and connections in social networks have been associated with its intemal ability and extemal opportunity to access and utilize new knowledge. Absorptive capacity determines a fm's ability to recognize, assimilate, and exploit novel information, and social networks affect the quantity and quality of information and knowledge a fm is exposed to. While these resources influence a fm's innovation output through distinct mechanisms, we propose that the contribution that each makes to a fm's innovative success is contingent on the level of the other factor that a firm possesses. We develop a simulation model to analyze the random information access and acquisition process of fms in social network contexts. The results demonstrate that in addition to the main effects of absorptive capacity and social network position on a fm's innovative output, there is a significant interaction effect. Still more the interaction effect might play a more important role and thus make the simple main effects less significant. ©2000 IEEE."

The establishment of STPs has also characterised the European ICT industry. The growing technological interrelatedness and the need to acquire capabilities in related fields have been identified in the literature as major explanations for the increase in corporate technological co-operation. This paper investigates the role of corporate technological specialisation factors in the conclusion of STPs in the European ICT industry by carrying out a dynamic analysis. Accordingly, the patterns followed by corporate technological partnerships in the industry in question are investigated since the late 1970s. Based on US patent data granted to the world's largest firms as well as STPs data, the results of the econometric analysis are consistent with the view that the more similar partners' technological portfolios are with one another, the easier it is to absorb each other's capabilities."

We use the organizational nature of production lines to argue that the performance of focused production lines will decline when the lines adopt new manufacturing tasks that are outside the scope of the absorptive capacity developed through the execution of their prior focused manufacturing task, but not otherwise. The study examines four years of data from 16 production lines of a compressor manufacturing factory of the Copeland Corporation.

However, nearly 50% of the new products that are introduced each year fail. Organizations thus find themselves in a double bind. On the one hand they must innovate consistently to remain competitive, but on the other hand innovation is risky and expensive. Many organizations are forming business alliances to quicken the pace of and reduce risks associated with innovation. Yet by some estimates, 70% of these alliances fail. Many of the prescriptions for successful alliance management clash with recommendations for effective innovation management. The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the new products and alliance literature. A construct - cooperative competency - derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment, absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether it is an intra-or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and replicate it in the health care sector.

This literature postulates that total factor productivity is higher when trade gives countries access to a wider or more sophisticated range of technologies. The articles reviewed here find considerable evidence that imported technologies raise total factor productivity in importing countries, particularly developing countries and particularly when technologies are acquired by way of imports of intermediate goods. They also provide some support for the argument that exports and foreign direct investment are channels for learning. Although access to foreign technologies has a positive impact on developing countries' total factor productivity, overall these countries are shown to purchase older and simpler machines than industrial countries. Relative factor and machinery costs and skill and technology endowments affect the choice of imported technologies. However, government attempts to limit or guide the selection of technologies are likely to have a negative effect on growth because they discourage producers from purchasing the most appropriate and efficient machines. Rather, policies aimed at promoting technological development should strengthen the absorptive capacity of importing countries and address the complementarity between human and physical capital in a broader context. © Oxford University Press 2001."

However, in the knowledge economy, competitiveness is increasingly based upon access to knowledge, in the form of skills and capabilities, wherever it is located in the world including the smaller industrialized countries. This paper extends the discussion of the impacts of globalization and localization to encompass other nations and their 'national innovation systems'. Policy underpinning national systems to encourage innovation is increasingly being called into question by the general move towards globalization and localization. Multi-national enterprises (MNEs) and localized clusters in the emerging technologies determine and control technological paths beyond and through national borders. Small industrialized nations which have neither a broad technological base, extensive science and technology infrastructure or resources, nor MNEs based in the country, run the risk of being marginalized when competing globally, through an inability to become involved in these international economic networks. A traditional policy response by small countries to the impact of globalization is to metaphorically 'batten down the hatches' against the invasion of MNEs and the exploitation of local resources. However, an exploration of the drivers of both globalization and localization in the knowledge economy, and the observed impacts of globalization on New Zealand, suggests that a suitable strategy for small nations might be the reverse scenario. By using the analogy of the small country as a small and medium sized enterprise (SME) in the global economy dominated by large nations and MNEs, SME advantages and disadvantages are mapped onto potential small country advantages and disadvantages. The simile is extended to propose a small-country strategy based on exploiting the documented advantages of SMEs, such as flexibility and use of external networks, for an outward-looking, supplier-orientated innovation policy. Such a policy has to be designed for rapid communication and flexibility, and has to encourage committed technological accumulation and networking, to maximize national absorptive and transformative capacities."

Many scholars suggest a firm's absorptive capacity plays a key role in the process of coevolution (Lewin et al., this issue). So far, most publications, in following Cohen and Levinthal (1990), have considered the level of prior related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive capacity. We suggest, however, that two specific organizational determinants of absorptive capacity should also be considered: organization forms and combinative capabilities. We will show how these organizational determinants influence the level of absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowledge. Subsequently, we will develop a framework in which absorptive capacity is related to both micro- and macrocoevolutionary effects. This framework offers an explanation of how knowledge environments coevolve with the emergence of organization forms and combinative capabilities that are suitable for absorbing knowledge. We will illustrate the framework by discussing two longitudinal case studies of traditional publishing firms moving into the turbulent knowledge environment of an emerging multimedia industrial complex."

In this respect, the firm's knowledge base determines its ability to recognize, assimilate and exploit externalities. Assuming that a firm's absorptive capacity also depends upon the characteristics of external knowledge, this paper analyses the relationship between three basic concepts empirically defined: the fundamental or applied nature of knowledge, the tacit or codified form of knowledge and the absorptive capacity of the firm. Based on a empirical analysis of R&D contracts between France's largest research institute and industrial firms, we show that a low absorptive capacity inhibits cooperation in R&D. The collaboration concerns mostly applied fields and needs informal interactions to support transfers (such as telephone calls, informal interviews and meetings). A high absorptive capacity extends the assimilation to all kinds of knowledge (applied, fundamental) through all types of vehicles (PhD students, scientific staff, technical devices). Altogether, absorption mechanisms seem to diversity as the firm's absorption capacity increases."

In addition to important size effects explaining innovation, we find that high perceived risks and costs and low appropriability of innovations do not discourage innovation, but rather determine how the innovation sourcing strategy is chosen. With respect to the determinants of the decision of the innovative firm to produce technology itself (Make) or to source technology externally (Buy), we find that small firms are more likely to restrict their innovation strategy to an exclusive make or buy strategy, while large firms are more likely to combine both internal and external knowledge acquisition in their innovation strategy. After controlling for this size effect, companies for which internal information is an important source for innovation are less likely to source exclusively, but rather combine internal and external sources of technology. The strength of the appropriation regime and the internal organisational resistance to change affect negatively the decision to source exclusively externally. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper investigates the evolution of the nuclear power program in Korea to exploit the development process of the nuclear power industry and key factors for the technological localization of nuclear power plants. In developing countries, an imitative catching-up process can be shown as a course for developing the absorptive capacity of foreign technology, which depends on prior knowledge base and the intensity of effort. The process of technological learning consists of five stages including preparation, implementation of foreign technology, acquisition of peripheral technology, acquisition of core technology, and improvement of foreign technology. Moreover, this paper discusses, six essential factors that have influenced the successful achievement of technological localization of nuclear power plants in Korea. They include the role and strategies of the government, the leading role of utility firms, the development and cooperation of the related organizations, the development of human resources and their efforts, market conditions and the assistance of foreign donors, and social conditions. Finally, this paper discusses implications offered by the Korean experience for other developing countries."

As sources for our analyses we reviewed the main empirical studies and gathered information and insights from 21 corporations. Our results show, firstly, that the internationalization of research and technology is still characterized by 'Triadization' involving companies from the US, the European Union and Japan. Secondly, qualitative motives are increasingly driving R&D location decisions, like learning from technological excellence and lead markets and dynamic interactions within the value chain. Thirdly, the process of internationalization in research and technology has been accompanied by an increasingly selective focus on a very few locations and the concentration of innovation activities on worldwide centers of excellence. We conclude that these changes in the innovation strategies of large multinational companies put several topics on the agenda for technology policy in Europe: (1) a stronger focus on extra-European collaboration and mobility, (2) strengthening the attractiveness of the European Union to foreign R&D investment and (3) the absorptive capacities of R&D organizations in Europe, (4) a stronger integration of different policy areas and of indirect policy measures (5) as well as the establishment of a transparent and global framework for policy coordination and priority-setting worldwide."

The analysis is supported by a number of case study examples in manufacturing industry based on field work conducted between 1993-1996. The theoretical approach draws particularly on the innovation and inward technology transfer literature, which uses the concepts of 'receptivity' and 'absorptive capacity' to explain the ability of organizations to assimilate new knowledge, but is also sensitized to the contested and sometimes conflictual nature of change processes. Particular emphasis is given to (a) the importance of good linkages with external sources of knowledge, including regulators, and (b) the extent to which the organizational culture encourages a pluralistic and participative approach. The case studies suggest that weaknesses with respect to the enforcement of the current regulatory framework and the lack of sufficient financial incentives (i.e. ecological tax reform) are liable to continue to give rise to selective approaches which do not fully address the cleaner production agenda. In conclusion, the analysis of the limitations of firm-based organizational learning, particularly with respect to the need to change consumption patterns, indicates the continuing need for a wider process of social learning."

The theory is based largely on Loewenstein's manageable gap perspective of curiosity as well as on the role that absorptive capacity plays in providing the learner's knowledge base. The theory posits that if a learner perceives a manageable gap between the base and the target learning and if the target learning is relevant to the learner's value system, strong internal tension-to-learn will result. At the same time, learning must be legitimized, and internal learning-based legitimization mechanisms are more powerful validation processes than are external performance-based ones. The authors note that some experiential learning situations can deter tension-to-learn because learners may perceive mastery of the exercise's operation as unmanageable. © 1998 Sage Publications, Inc."

Firms access upstream basic research through investments in absorptive capacity in the form of in- house basic research and 'pro- publication' internal incentives. Some firms also maintain extensive connections to the wider scientific community, which we measure using data on coauthorship of scientific papers between pharmaceutical company scientists and publicly funded researchers. 'Connectedness' is significantly correlated with firms' internal organization, as well as their performance in drug discovery. The estimated impact of 'connectedness' on private research productivity implies a substantial return to public investments in basic research."

However, this definition of the construct suggests that a firm has an equal capacity to learn from all other organizations. We reconceptualize the firm-level construct absorptive capacity as a learning dyad-level construct, relative absorptive capacity. One firm's ability to learn from another firm is argued to depend on the similarity of both firms' (1) knowledge bases, (2) organizational structures and compensation policies, and (3) dominant logics. We then test the model using a sample of pharmaceutical-biotechnology R&D alliances. As predicted, the similarity of the partners' basic knowledge, lower management formalization, research centralization, compensation practices, and research communities were positively related to interorganizational learning. The relative absorptive capacity measures are also shown to have greater explanatory power than the established measure of absorptive capacity, R&D spending. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Hyundai Motor Company, the most dynamic automobile producer in developing countries, pursued a strategy of independence in developing absorptive capacity. In its process of advancing from one phase to the next through the preparation for and acquisition, assimilation, and improvement of foreign technologies, Hyundai acquired migratory knowledge to expand its prior knowledge base and proactively constructed crises as a strategic means of intensifying its learning effort. Unlike externally evoked crises, proactively constructed internal crises present a clear performance gap, shift learning orientation from imitation to innovation, and increase the intensity of effort in organizational learning. Such crisis construction is an evocative and galvanizing device in the personal repertoires of proactive top managers. A similar process of opportunistic learning is also evident in other industries in Korea."

Specifically, we argue that alliance intent may be described, at any time, as having either exploitation or exploration objectives. We further discuss how the morphology of an alliance - absorptive capacity, control, and identification - may be isomorphic with its intent, and, in the aggregate, drive the evolution of the population of alliances."

Firms enter into these types of alliances to create economic value and to acquire knowledge to enhance their competencies. The degree to which the partners can realize their objectives is dependent on their absorptive capacities and the collaborative strategies adopted by the partners. Outcome and process discrepancies may emerge as collaboration unfolds. Outcome discrepancies concern the ability of the partners to achieve their economic and learning objectives. Process discrepancies relate to the partners' satisfaction with the pattern of interaction, and affect their feelings of psychological attachment to the relationship. How the partners assess and react to discrepancies shapes the developmental path of an alliance. The alliance flourishes in certain stales but may collapse in others as the collaboration is subjected to environmental changes or shifts in the grand strategies of the partners. Guidelines for assessing and managing outcome and process discrepancies are suggested."

This study investigates the relationship between IJV success and the strategic and organizational traits of local partners. We address this issue in the context of an emerging economy (P.R. China). Newly emerging economies have in recent years become major hosts of direct investment by multinational corporations (MNCs) because these rapidly expanding economies, characterized by an exploding demand previously stifled by ideologically-based government intervention, provide tremendous opportunities which MNCs can preempt. MNCs in such economies, however, face the challenges of structural reform, weak market structure, poorly specified property rights, and institutional uncertainty. Right local partners can help MNCs boost market expansion, obtain insightful information, mitigate operational risks, and provide country-specific knowledge. The analysis of the data obtained from China suggests that both strategic and organizational traits of local partners are significantly associated with some individual dimensions of IJV performance. Among strategic traits, absorptive capacity, product relatedness, and market power are favorable to IJVs' market and financial outcomes. Market power and experience significantly reduce IJVs' operational uncertainties. Of organizational traits, international experience and organizational collaboration are important for IJVs' not only profitability and stability but also local market expansion and export growth. Organizational form and size influence IJVs' local market performance. The findings provided by this study can help MNCs determine what criteria they should use in opting for local partners and what criteria are vital to their goal accomplishment. Those investors seeking local market expansion should select those local partners that have rich market experience, superior market position, high absorptive capacity, and related product diversification with the IJVs. Those seeking profitability and stability should select local firms that have superior international experience, longer organizational collaboration, and greater market power. While MNCs should use appropriate strategic and organizational criteria to select local partners, the host government or local firms can try to make these traits available to attract more stable and profitable foreign direct investment."

We appreciate the paper's extensive qualitative discussion of the nature and role of absorptive capacity. We also commend the authors' idea of constructing a mathematical model to analyze a rational firm's incentives for an investment in absorptive capacity. However, we find that the authors' model overlooks one key element of a firm's absorptive capacity, namely, the firm's ability to defend itself against the threat of an external technology. In the absence of that element, the authors' model may be able to explain a firm's incentives for an innovation rather than incentives for the development of an absorptive capacity. We also identify several internal inconsistencies in the authors' mathematical model. For example, the assumed profit maximization function seems inconsistent with the assumed degree of sophistication of the firm's probability assessment behavior. We believe that the inconsistencies and shortcomings noted here raise serious questions about the validity of the authors' findings. However, we hope that this note does not detract from the pioneering nature of the authors' work, but instead increases its value by stimulating further work on the important topic of absorptive capacity."

However, for the most part this literature assumes that firms adopt a uniform IS governance solution for all business units and that this solution can be predicted by context variables at the overall organization level. The purpose of this study is to increase our knowledge about why firms implement a hybrid IS governance solution in which a subset of IS functions that includes systems development is decentralized to some business units, but not to other business units, in the same enterprise. A theoretical framework of context variables at the business unit level is first developed. An embedded, single case study provides an initial test of eight propositions derived from the framework, as well as an opportunity for theory building. Data are collected utilizing both deductive and inductive methods from IS and non-IS executives of a divisionalized Fortune 500 firm in which a uniform decentralized solution for systems development in place for almost a decade has recently been replaced by a hybrid solution. The case study findings suggest that a configuration of four variables characterizes a business unit context conducive to decentralized systems development governance (organic decision-making, high business unit autonomy, a differentiation competitive strategy, and an unstable industry environment). As predicted, however, the influence of these variables is likely to be overridden and a ""deviant"" solution adopted when deficiencies in IT capabilities are perceived and there is a culture that supports structural change at the business unit level. Additional interview and survey data collected from the key stakeholders are then analyzed in order to develop a richer understanding of the dimensions of the IT capabilities construct at the business unit level. The notion of absorptive capacity provides a theoretical argument for the emergent findings. Implications for researching today's increasingly complex IS governance forms are then drawn."

First, they object to two key elements of the model structure: the relevance of the monopoly analysis and the appropriateness of modeling competition via an entry model. Second, JBH express concern over the manner in which we have modeled the updating process. With regard to the basic model structure, we argue that the initial monopoly analysis allows us to capture some important notions regarding the path dependent nature of investment in technical capabilities. Further, the analysis of competition by an entry model does not presume that an established firm takes the initiative which is one of JBH's key objections. The structure merely implies that some firm, possibly a start-up enterprise, moves first. With regard to the concerns over the modeling of updating, we acknowledge that our notation could have been clearer in some instances but that does not negate the correctness of the analysis. Furthermore, JBH's recommendations regarding the updating process have the same qualitative properties as our own specification. Indeed, at no point in their critique do JBH ever indicate how their proposed specification would change the results of our analysis."

Using a new measure of changes in alliance partners' technological capabilities, based on the citation patterns of their patent portfolios, we analyze changes in the extent to which partner firms' technological resources 'overlap' as a result of alliance participation. This measure allows us to test hypotheses from the literature on interfirm knowledge transfer in alliances, with interesting results: we find support for some elements of this 'received wisdom' - equity arrangements promote greater knowledge transfer, and 'absorptive capacity' helps explain the extent of technological capability transfer, at least in some alliances. But the results also suggest limits to the 'capabilities acquisition' view of strategic alliances. Consistent with the argument that alliance activity can promote increased specialization, we find that the capabilities of partner firms become more divergent in a substantial subset of alliances."

The author analyzes internal stickiness of knowledge transfer and tests the resulting model using canonical correlation analysis of a data set consisting of 271 observations of 122 best-practice transfers in eight companies. Contrary to conventional wisdom that blames primarily motivational factors, the study findings show the major barriers to internal knowledge transfer to be knowledge-related factors such as the recipient's lack of absorptive capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous relationship between the source and the recipient."

The often empirically observed 50/50 sharing rule in asymmetric alliances is compared to a bargained rule, where asymmetries in absorptive capacity, as well as R&D and production efficiency are explicitly taken into account. Industry settings in which successful asymmetric alliances are more likely to occur are pinpointed. The analysis focuses on the influence of the size and format of these asymmetries, the technological appropriability and complementarity between partners on the incentives for both partners to cooperate as well as to cheat on the venture agreement. The results are compared to a setting where the joint venture is only involved in R&D."
"The labour relations heritage and lean manufacturing at Fiat","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84972950174&doi=10.1080%2f09585199500000048&partnerID=40&md5=c76b4ac26bdd9ef3bdf5ee2c7ce1ed1a","The objective of the paper is interpreting, from an evolutionary perspective, recent developments of work organization and human resource management policies at Fiat Auto, one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers, which achieved a successful restructuring in the early 1990s. Building on a heritage of adversarial labour relations and ‘mass production’ organizational principles, Fiat developed an original and to some extent hybrid version of ‘lean’ human resource management practices (teamwork, flexible compensation, multi-skilling, etc.). The paper analyses this process of organizational change from an evolutionary perspective based on the concept of dynamic capabilities. From this standpoint, IR. HRM and work organization practices are the result of a learning process, based on original development, imitation, analogical replication, combination and selection of organizational capabilities; organizational capabilities have a cumulative and path-dependent nature; workplace innovations are also rooted in organizational absorptive capacities, that is, the ability of firms to exploit new (and often extramural) organizational and HRM developments; the existence of complementarities among organizational competencies, assets and choices in term of HRM are likely to push toward the adoption of a set or system of (rather than single and insulated) innovations in work organization, HRM practices and industrial relations policies. The data provided in the paper show that the process of innovation of workplace practices at Fiat Auto (summarized by the concept of the Fabbrica Integrata) is curiously non-linear. The newly designed HRM policies have, on the one hand, been resisted by the unions (who have not been involved in the design process) and by segments of the work-force; on the other hand, they have been hindered by existing organizational features and personnel practices which, in turn, were key success factors during the 1980s. This inertia is significantly lower at the new greenfield plant of Melfi. On the whole, the restructuring process was successful from the competitive and financial standpoint, and represents the basis on which management and the unions can develop a new co-operative model of industrial relations. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The main goal of this framework is to guard and update the knowledge-base of the institutions and actors that allow firms to recognize the value of external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends: national absorptive capacity (NAC). After presenting the framework, the author discusses a recent Danish innovation and technology policy exercise, the Resource Area Analysis (RAA), to illustrate the relevance of the approach. © 1995."

A conceptual model is developed which suggests that responsiveness is a function of how firm's develop their ""absorptive capacity"" (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). The critical role played by the firm's technology sourcing practices is discussed. The macro processes of technical and economic change are also considered, in terms of how they shape the firm's technology sourcing strategy. © 1995."
"Technological regimes and innovation in services: the case of the Italian banking industry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000246939&doi=10.1016%2f0048-7333%2893%2900756-J&partnerID=40&md5=5766abc29b693119ee3be0c2339e0bb1","In this paper we propose a conceptual model to analyse innovations originating from the diffusion of Information Technologies in the banking sector. We argue that technical change in this industry exhibits a revolutionary character. A distinction is made between the 'mass automation' regime, focusing mainly on the mechanization of back-office procedures in the 1960s and 1970s, and the 'smart automation' regime, originating from the introduction of distributed data processing and network technologies and centered around the supply of electronic banking services. A theoretical model is developed which emphasizes the crucial role played by demand-pull variables in stimulating innovative behaviour under the smart automation regime. In contrast, limited importance is attributed to cumulative and learning-by-doing effects relating to back-office automation, at least for banks endowed with sufficient absorptive capacity. The theoretical hypotheses are tested through an econometric analysis of the determinants of the innovative behaviour in electronic payment systems of a sample of Italian commercial banks. © 1995."
"The influence of IT management practice on IT use in large organizations","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000880687&partnerID=40&md5=0d6bc56b7cf3eb21766bb1398d62542b","This paper draws upon the absorptive capacity as the theoretical basis for a pragmatic explanation of key factors affecting information technology (IT) use in large, complex organizations. IT use is defined as the extent to which an organization deploys IT to support operational and strategic tasks. The study uses results from a survey of senior IT managers from 132 firms to examine hypothesized relationships among the following constructs: IT management climate, managerial IT knowledge, IT-management-process effectiveness, and IT use. A structural-equation model is developed using LISREL to assess the relative effects of and inter-relationships among these constructs. The study's findings indicate that managerial IT knowledge is a dominant factor in explaining high levels of IT use and that both managerial IT knowledge and IT-management-process effectiveness are influenced by IT management climate."

Cotton-bicomponent staple webs","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028112601&partnerID=40&md5=b5c7c6b43b7b9c21f38a59d5091d4065","Some bonding techniques for cotton nonwoven fabrics result in a loss of the fibre's desirable properties. Thermal point bonding, using a binder fibre, should provide aesthetically pleasing nonwoven fabrics with cotton while maintaining absorbency, softness and drape. This study, uses a polypropylene sheath and poly(ethylene terephthalate) core binder fibres to bond cotton fibrewebs. The effects of cotton content in the blend, basis weight and calender roll temperature on the tensile properties, thickness, air resistance and water absorptive capacity are studied using a partial factorial designed experiment. The data is regressed using a second order equation with cross-products to obtain the response surfaces, which would permit optimizations to be made for specific properties. The combination of cotton and bicomponent fibre which gives aesthetically pleasing fabrics that should have commercial value are found."
"Technological systems and economic policy: the diffusion of factory automation in Sweden","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38149147327&doi=10.1016%2f0048-7333%2894%2990036-1&partnerID=40&md5=1a71fc1bcd01084b6ecfb96429e4a897","This paper argues that technological systems (defined as networks of agents interacting in each specific area of technology under a particular institutional infrastructure) constitute a useful unit of analysis for not only innovation and diffusion studies but also work related to technology policy. In the case of Sweden's technological system for factory automation (e.g. robots), it is suggested that three features are central to explaining the extensive diffusion of new technology in the Swedish engineering industry, namely 'bridging institutions', user-supplier linkages, and critical mass coupled to advanced economic competence among a key set of users. As regards public policy, it is argued that its role is to facilitate the formation of new technological systems and to enhance the functioning of existing systems rather than to rectify individual market failures. This can be done by creating or strengthening 'bridging institutions' and centers of excellence, promoting speedy and wide diffusion of engineering competence, and strengthening compensating mechanisms when important nodes in the networks fail. Given the difficulty of identifying future technological opportunities, the simultaneous pursuit of alternative strategies, early identification of important developments, and increasing the absorptive capacity of the economy become important aspects of public policy. © 1994."

Capabilities are at the root of a carefully nurtured reputation, which builds up over years or even decades. Such reputational assets allow a company to operate successfully in the specialist, niche car market. Technological leadership, being part of a niche market strategy, in turn provides value to the company not only in terms of actual product ‘inventions’, but also in terms of higher ‘absorptive capacity’. This virtuous circle suggests that there are substantial first-mover advantages in technological innovation for niche manufacturers, above and beyond those commonly identified in the economics literature. However, these first-mover advantages are more difficult to demonstrate in the case of volume producers, unless there are ambitions to move into a niche at least with part of the product line. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"Rapid technology change, “technological visions” corporate organisation and market structure","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0346650227&doi=10.1080%2f10438599200000002&partnerID=40&md5=5ea14403cfc8108bcc71c3814ad7623e","This paper is a contribution to the analysis of how rapid technology change influences market structure. The paper uses a simple simulation model to explore the effects of four main factors on the development of market structure. These are: (1) the variance (or unpredictability) of the technology trajectory; (2) the speed with which the organisation's “technological vision” adjusts to ongoing technological developments; (3) the absorptive capacity of each division in the multi-divisional firm to experience gained in other divisions; (4) the extent to which competence-destroying innovations generate greater cost penalties for the division of a multi-divisional firm than for a comparable mono-divisional firm. Simultion results are obtained for 100 technological trajectories, and a variety of parameterisations. While there is a tendency for noisier trajectories to disadvantage the larger multi-divisional firm, there are conditions under which such a firm benefits from a noisy technological environment. When competence-destorying innovations affect the division of a multi-divisional firm no worse than the comparable mono-divisional firm, the multi-divisional firm is not disproportionately affected by a noisy trajectory. It may, however, be seriously damaged by a slow adjustment of technological vision, especially when all scale economies are dynamic (rather than static). The simulations confirm that the absorptive capacity of each division to experience from others can be critical in determining the ultimate market structure. A brief empirical motivation for the model is offered by reference to some case studies of the semiconductor industry. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."

The development of a nation, however, neither starts nor ends with economic development alone. It should encompass much more than that if it is both to bear and to enjoy the fruits of economic development. This paper is not intended to dwell on the pros and cons of these conflicting views. Instead, we will discuss the policies and strategies of science and technology development in the industrialization of a developing country from a point of view of industrial growth as the prime source of impetus for national development. Some of the leading industrial sectors in a developing country are geared primarily to breaking the inertia of underdevelopment of many kinds. They introduce technology quite advanced relative to their absorptive capacity, but feeder industries supporting the leader sectors do not necessary require such advanced technology. We desire, therefore, to look at the issue from both the national and the local points of view so that what is thought to be the ideal-""production by the masses"" not ""mass production,"" involving both leader and feeder industries-can be realized. One pressing problem in developing these lead-sector industries was whether or not they could be operated at full or at least near-full capacity. It was found that the allowance was extremely small because of the fact the cost of the capital for these industries, which mostly originated abroad, was very much higher than for the advanced countries. In addition, the adaptation of a lead-sector approach with greater economy of scale necessitated the introduction to industry of new, more, and higher level technologies of an order of magnitude never before experienced. It is an irreversible decision so far as science and technology development are concerned and was an issue of survival or extinction in an ever-stiffening international competition. For these reasons, the Korean government opted to begin with a formulation of intensive policies and strategies for the development of science and technology with many innovative supporting measures. The major elements of the policy guidelines for the 1970s were:1.Provision of a secure foundation for scientific and technologic growth;2.Strategic development of industrial technology, and3.Creation of a favorable climate for science and technology. This was followed by concrete planning to execute these policies. In this plan, Korea adopted what might be called a three-pronged approach, emphasizing capability build-up-particularly manpower development at various levels-accelerated introduction of foreign technologies, and stimulation of domestic R&D activities. To this end, the implementation plan was formulated with consideration for the institutional and legal factors, among others. For the institutional framework, the Korean approach was somewhat daring. It included the establishment of 1) the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in 1967 as the central policy-making, planning, coordinating, and promotional body in the government; 2) the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, by a special law (KIST Assistant Act) in 1966, as an autonomous, multidisciplinary industrial-research institute chartered as a contract research organization; 3) the Korea Technology Development Corporation, as a financial intermediary to ensure a smooth flow of money for R&D purposes; 4) the Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS) in 1971, in addition to the many existing universities and colleges, as a mission-oriented postgraduate school in selected applied sciences and engineering, to educate high-caliber scientists and engineers in number and in quality sufficient enough to meet the emerging needs of Korean industry; and 5) a huge number of vocational-training institutes along with technical high schools to meet the rapidly rising, almost explosive demand for skilled workers and technicians. The emergence of the Ministry of Science and Technology spearheaded the enactment of several very important laws for the development of science and technology. They include the Science and Technology Advancement Law, the Law for the Promotion of Industrial Technology Development, and the National Technical Qualification Law. © 1986 Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc."
